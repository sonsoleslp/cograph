# Motif and Subgraph Audit — Conservative Plan

Status: Gates 1 and the repository-local portion of Gate 2 are
implemented and uncommitted. No executable motif logic has been changed.
No behavioral change is authorized by this plan.

Date: 2026-09-04

## Conclusion first

The August 2026 motif overhaul already fixed the broad correctness
failures. The current directed MAN classifier, census counts, default
`edge_method = "any"` inference, individual aggregation, empirical
p-values, and motif glyph classes are protected by regression and
equivalence tests.

The first draft of this plan was too broad. It treated unsupported or
ambiguous inputs as confirmed regressions and proposed new policies for
directedness, undirected motifs, actorless windows, input validation,
zero-row materialization, and plotting. The motif vignette does not
establish those policies, and they must not be introduced as fixes.

## Intended contract recovered from the vignettes

- [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md) and
  [`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md)
  analyze the 16 MAN classes of **directed** triads.
- The primary workflow is a directed TNA/transition model.
- Matrix examples are asymmetric transition matrices.
- The igraph example is explicitly created with `mode = "directed"`.
- Raw edge-list examples contain a session/actor column and represent
  directed transitions from `from` to `to`.
- Windowing is documented as splitting **each actor’s** ordered
  transitions.
- [`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md)
  identifies which node triples participate in a MAN class. The vignette
  does not promise that a canonical class panel recovers the nodes’
  observed source/sink roles.
- The `edge_method = "expected"` tutorial example explicitly disables
  significance.
- Nestimate’s cograph tutorial distinguishes directed transition
  estimators from undirected co-occurrence estimators. Separately, the
  cograph motif examples use a directed TNA transition model.

## Verified baseline that must remain unchanged

1.  All 64 directed three-node adjacency patterns map to the same MAN
    class as
    [`igraph::triad_census()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/triad_census.html).
2.  Every canonical motif glyph belongs to its labeled MAN isomorphism
    class.
3.  `motifs(pattern = "all")` classifies every triad and its counts sum
    to `choose(n, 3)`; absent classes do not need public zero rows to
    satisfy that census identity.
4.  Individual census and named-instance totals agree per MAN type.
5.  The simple-graph null in
    [`motif_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motif_census.md)
    and the weighted directed stub-matching null in individual analysis
    remain separate, intentionally different null models.
6.  The deterministic 1,000-dataset equivalence sweep remains at zero
    failures.
7.  The current motif-focused test suite remains green.

## Audit disposition

### Already fixed — do not reopen

The fixes in `3c62819b` and `6e362b71` cover the earlier MAN-labeling,
directed census, 003 inclusion, instance aggregation, null-statistic,
self-loop, eligibility, fractional-stub balancing, p-value, and
plot-ranking defects. These are non-regression targets, not new work.

### Confirmed open limitations — already documented in the August handoff

The non-`"any"` cases must be kept distinct:

1.  **Deferred A — named-instance statistic mismatch.** In individual
    named-instance significance
    ([`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md)
    or `motifs(named_nodes = TRUE)`) with `edge_method = "percent"` or
    `"expected"`, the observed triad is thresholded but the optimized
    null path classifies raw stub presence. The observed and null
    statistics therefore do not measure exactly the same event.
2.  **Deferred B — fractional mass scale.** For fractional transition
    weights, the support-preserving integerization used by the weighted
    stub null promotes every positive sub-0.5 value to one stub. This
    preserves edge support but can distort mass-sensitive
    `percent`/`expected` inference in unified individual census, unified
    individual named-instance analysis, and both individual and
    aggregate
    [`extract_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_motifs.md)
    significance. This remains true where a path correctly reapplies the
    threshold to each replicate.
3.  **Accepted limitation C — aggregate threshold asymmetry.** Unified
    aggregate census significance with a non-`"any"` edge method
    deliberately delegates to the unthresholded
    [`motif_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motif_census.md)
    and emits a warning. This is a visible limitation, not one of the
    two deferred handoff findings; the tutorial does not demonstrate
    thresholded aggregate significance.

Default `edge_method = "any"` analyses are unaffected by these
limitations. Descriptive counts with significance disabled are also
unaffected.

### Not established as defects

The following items are removed from the fixing scope unless a separate
public contract is approved:

- actorless two-column edge-list directedness;
- actorless windowing or treating overlapping windows as independent
  actors;
- routing unified MAN APIs to an undirected four-class census;
- adding a new public `directed` argument to
  [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md)/[`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md);
- materializing zero-count MAN rows in the public result;
- changing `percent` threshold units or defaults;
- redefining `min_count`, `min_transitions`, `top`, or include/exclude
  precedence;
- introducing new weight aliases or broad input-schema coercion;
- changing named-subgraph diagrams to claim an exact observed node-role
  orientation; and
- changing any MAN description or canonical glyph without a minimal,
  externally verified counterexample.

The observed difference between `motifs(raw_edge_list)` and
`motifs(as_cograph(raw_edge_list))` for an actorless one-way cycle is
real, but the vignette does not define the intended semantics of that
ambiguous generic input. It is therefore a contract question, not
evidence of incorrect motif directedness.

## Conservative fixing plan

### Gate 1 — Freeze the known-good behavior

Before any implementation proposal:

- retain the 64-pattern MAN oracle and the 1,000-dataset sweep;
- add small vignette-contract tests for directed TNA, directed igraph,
  asymmetric matrix, grouped edge list, and per-actor windows;
- pin seeded matrix-versus-directed-igraph equality;
- pin actor-column auto-detection and explicit actor override;
- pin all four pattern filters plus include/exclude precedence;
- pin one row per `(node triple, MAN type)` and session-occurrence
  meaning for individual
  [`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md)
  results;
- pin default `edge_method = "any"` result tables and seeded inference
  on representative aggregate and individual fixtures;
- pin non-vacuous canaries for the triad-total `percent` denominator and
  the three documented non-`"any"` inference boundaries;
- record that no executable motif logic differs before work begins.

This gate adds tests only and must not alter output.

### Gate 2 — Clarify documentation only

Without changing runtime behavior, make the supported boundary explicit:

- unified
  [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md)/[`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md)
  are directed MAN analyses;
- edge-list examples are directed transitions, and windowing is per
  actor;
- aggregate non-`"any"` significance uses the unthresholded null and
  warns;
- individual named-instance non-`"any"` significance has the documented
  null limitation; and
- `percent` uses the current six-edge triad-total denominator; the
  vignette’s statement that it uses all outgoing transitions from a node
  is documentation drift and does not authorize a runtime change;
- “configuration model” must distinguish the aggregate simple-graph,
  degree-preserving rewiring null from the individual weighted
  target-stub null with integerized margins and loopless simple
  projection; these models are not interchangeable;
- concrete labels in an aggregated subgraph panel identify participating
  nodes, not their observed node-role orientation.

The dedicated tutorial at
`/Users/mohammedsaqr/Documents/Github/cograph_local_artifacts/tutorials/cograph-tutorial-motifs.qmd`
is an external artifact and is not writable or committable from this
cograph worktree. It still contains the broad “exact configuration
model” wording and the incorrect per-source description of `percent`.
Documentation completeness remains pending until that source is
synchronized before its next publication.

The vignette’s `201` label (“Double mutual”) and the internal
description (“Mutual + in-star”) are also wording drift. Reconcile the
label only if a single presentation term is desired; do not alter
classification. The prior decision not to swap `111D`/`111U` remains
intact.

If the repository-local warning and documentation are judged sufficient,
the repository-local portion of this gate can close with no further
changes. The external tutorial synchronization remains pending as stated
above.

### Gate 3 — Statistical design decision (requires explicit approval)

Choose one policy for deferred A and B only:

1.  **Restrict inference:** reject or disable significance for affected
    `percent`/`expected` paths while retaining descriptive counts; or
2.  **Implement matched inference:** make every null replicate
    reconstruct weighted edge multiplicities and apply the identical
    thresholding statistic, with a separately approved rule for
    fractional-weight integerization.

Neither option is selected by this audit. Both change behavior and
require owner approval plus statistical review. Accepted limitation C
remains documentation-only unless it receives its own, separate approval
decision.

Any new mass-preserving conversion must be isolated to non-`"any"`
inference. It must not modify the existing
`.motif_configuration_stubs()` behavior or RNG sequence used by default
`edge_method = "any"` analyses.

### Gate 4 — If, and only if, Gate 3 is approved

- write failing tests for the two already documented reproductions;
- implement the smallest path-specific change rather than refactoring
  every motif wrapper;
- rerun all motif tests, all 64 MAN patterns, the 1,000-dataset sweep,
  and the relevant vignette examples;
- report exact before/after deltas only for non-`"any"` inference; and
- stop if any default count, MAN label, supported directedness result,
  or default seeded inference changes unexpectedly.

## Release acceptance criteria

- Default `edge_method = "any"` behavior is unchanged.
- Default `"any"` seeded RNG results are unchanged.
- MAN classification and directedness in all documented workflows are
  unchanged.
- No public signature or result schema changes without separate
  approval.
- Any approved statistical change is limited to the explicitly approved
  non-`"any"` significance paths and is documented in NEWS.
- The external dedicated motif tutorial is synchronized before
  publication; until then, documentation completeness is explicitly
  pending.
- All motif tests and equivalence sweeps pass.

## Explicit non-goal

This plan does not redesign motifs, broaden their domain, or reinterpret
old results. It protects the fixes already landed and leaves the two
previously deferred statistical choices behind an approval gate.
