# Centrality Zoo lookup

The [Centrality Zoo](https://centralityzoo.github.io/) (Shvydun, 2025,
*Zoo of Centralities: Encyclopedia of Node Metrics in Complex Networks*,
[arXiv:2511.05122](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05122)) catalogues 349
node centrality measures and publishes how similarly they rank nodes.
This page answers one question: **if you are looking for a measure from
the Zoo, what does `cograph` offer?**

Every measure in the [Centrality
Zoo](https://centralityzoo.github.io/comparison/) (349 measures, Shvydun
2025) appears exactly once below. `tau` is the average Kendall rank
correlation between Zoo implementations over 648 empirical networks. A
mapped cograph name identifies a corresponding definition; these are not
comparisons against cograph outputs. Values are rounded: displayed 1.00
does not prove exact rank or numerical equivalence.

| Section | Meaning | Count |
|----|----|----|
| Available | cograph implements the measure itself | 166 |
| Correlated candidate (tau \>= 0.90) | not implemented; a mapped Zoo measure has high average rank correlation | 118 |
| Not available (tau \< 0.90) | not implemented; nearest mapped Zoo measure has lower average correlation | 65 |

Only 166 of the 349 Zoo labels are mapped as implemented. Another 118
have a correlated candidate, including 23 at tau \>= 0.99. Correlation
does not establish interchangeable measures.

Caveat: the Zoo computed tau on undirected, unweighted networks, so
agreement on a directed or weighted network may be lower. Rank agreement
does not establish numerical equivalence or accuracy. No fixed
conversion between Kendall and Spearman correlation is assumed.

## Correlated candidates (tau \>= 0.90)

These measures are not implemented. The nearest mapped Zoo measure is a
research lead, not a verified substitute. Average correlation alone
cannot establish equivalence on an individual network.
