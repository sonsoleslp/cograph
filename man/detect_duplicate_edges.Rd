\title{Detect Duplicate Edges in Undirected Network}
\usage{
detect_duplicate_edges(edges)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{Data frame with \code{from} and \code{to} columns (and optionally
\code{weight}).}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{has_duplicates}{Logical indicating whether any duplicates were found.}
\item{info}{A list of duplicate details, where each element contains:
\code{nodes} (the node pair), \code{count} (number of edges), and
\code{weights} (vector of weights if available).}
}
}
\description{
Identifies edges that appear multiple times between the same pair of nodes.
For undirected networks, edges A\code{->}B and B\code{->}A are considered duplicates.
For directed networks, only identical from\code{->}to pairs are duplicates.
}
\details{
This function is useful for cleaning network data before visualization.
Duplicate edges can arise from:
\itemize{
\item Data collection errors (same edge recorded twice)
\item Combining multiple data sources
\item Converting from formats that allow multi-edges
\item Edge lists that include both A\code{->}B and B\code{->}A for undirected networks
}

The function creates canonical keys by sorting node pairs (lower index first),
so edges 1\code{->}2 and 2\code{->}1 map to the same key "1-2" in undirected mode.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create edges with duplicates
edges <- data.frame(
  from = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3),
  to = c(2, 2, 3, 1, 1),
  weight = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.2)
)

# Detect duplicates (undirected: 1-2 appears 3 times, 1-3 appears 2 times)
result <- detect_duplicate_edges(edges)
result$has_duplicates
# [1] TRUE

# View duplicate details
result$info[[1]]
# $nodes: 1, 2
# $count: 3
# $weights: 0.5, 0.3, 0.6
}
