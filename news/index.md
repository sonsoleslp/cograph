# Changelog

## cograph 2.3.0

### Documentation

- Audited every R/\*.R function file for roxygen/Rd accuracy. Corrected
  stale defaults (`cr_color` `#D4820A` -\> `#D4829A` in `plot-forest.R`;
  `show_value` default `FALSE` -\> `TRUE` in `splot-nodes.R`), corrected
  dataset dimensions in `data-hai.R` (`302` -\> `429 x 287`), corrected
  a reference to the nonexistent
  [`igraph::is_bipartite()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/is_bipartite.html)
  (now `bipartite_mapping()`), expanded
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  `@param` measure lists for `mode`, `cutoff`, `invert_weights`, and
  `membership` to match the implementation, dropped baked-in measure
  counts that rot on each addition, and removed nonexistent themes from
  `sn_theme` documentation. No runtime behavior changes from the
  documentation pass itself.

### Bug fixes

- [`plot_simplicial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_simplicial.md)
  now warns when `anomaly` is set on an input that has no anomaly
  concept (HON, association rules, link prediction, character pathways,
  `method = "hon"` / `"rules"`). Previously the argument was silently
  dropped, so calls like `plot_simplicial(hon, anomaly = "over")` and
  `plot_simplicial(hon, anomaly = "under")` produced byte-identical
  plots. `anomaly` is honored only for `net_hypa` inputs and
  `method = "hypa"` auto-builds.

### Centrality

- [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  gains an umbrella argument `tna_network` (logical or NULL). When
  `TRUE` (or auto-detected from a `tna`/`group_tna`/`ctna`/
  `ftna`/`atna` input), all measures shared with
  [`tna::centralities()`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/centralities.md)
  match byte-for-byte: `loops = FALSE`, `invert_weights = TRUE`,
  `diffusion_method = "power_series"`, `transitivity_type = "onnela"`.
  Side-by-side audit confirms zero divergence on `OutStrength`,
  `InStrength`, `ClosenessIn/Out/All`, `Betweenness`, `Diffusion`,
  `Clustering` (`max|diff| = 0`). Any per-argument override the user
  passes explicitly always wins over the umbrella.
- [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  (and
  [`centrality_diffusion()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_diffusion.md))
  gain a `diffusion_method = c("kandhway_kuri", "power_series")`
  argument. The default `NULL` auto-detects: `"power_series"` for tna
  inputs (matches `tna::centralities(., measures = "Diffusion")`
  byte-for-byte when `loops = FALSE`), `"kandhway_kuri"` (the existing
  1-hop binary-degree formula, Kandhway & Kuri 2014) for everything
  else. Previously cograph’s diffusion silently disagreed with tna’s
  because cograph used an unweighted neighborhood-degree sum while tna
  uses `rowSums(P + P^2 + ... + P^n)` on the diagonal-zeroed weighted
  matrix — the same name covered two different statistics. Set
  explicitly to override the auto-detect.

### Tests

- Added a regression test in
  `tests/testthat/test-validate-nestimate-bootstrap-permutation.R`
  asserting that
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  on a Nestimate `netobject` agrees with
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  on its `$weights` matrix when the diagonal is non-zero. Locks in the
  upstream Nestimate fix to `.extract_edges_from_matrix()` (Nestimate
  \>= 2026-05-02) which now preserves self-loops in `$edges`. Without
  that fix, loop-bearing netobjects
  (e.g. `Nestimate::build_mcml() |> Nestimate::as_tna()`) silently
  under-counted node degree by 2.

### Plotting — edge-label cex coupling (Phase 2)

- Default `edge_label_size` is now coupled to the node label cex at a
  fixed 0.55 fraction (`edge_cex = 0.55 * mean(node_label_cex)`) so the
  node-to-edge-label ratio stays a stable ~1.82x across canvases. This
  replaces the previous `EDGE_LABEL_SCALE_CAP`-based compensation, which
  let the ratio drift from 2.5x at reference to 3.6x at poster canvases
  because edge labels were clamped to a tighter 1.6 ceiling while node
  labels scaled freely to 2.3. The visible effect: edge weight
  annotations are now readable at poster sizes instead of shrinking
  relative to node labels. User-explicit `edge_label_size` still wins
  and receives the same (capped) visual-scale compensation as before;
  only the default path changed.
- Edge-label visual_scale resolution moved from
  [`render_edges_splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/render_edges_splot.md)
  into `splot.R` so the final cex is produced in a single place.

### Plotting — device-aware visual scaling

- [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) now
  applies device-dependent compensation to text, line, and point sizes
  so visual ratios (label-to-node, legend-to-plot, edge thickness) stay
  consistent when the output device changes. This fixes the
  long-standing “labels too big at high DPI” and “legend desynchronised
  from the plot” issues when saving PNGs at `res = 300` or `res = 600`
  with pixel-default `width`/`height`, and when resizing the RStudio
  plot pane. Implementation: a single `compute_visual_scale()` reads the
  active device’s canvas size (`dev.size("in")`) and returns multipliers
  keyed off a 5.9-inch reference (matching the default RStudio 7×5” pane
  so backward-compatible behaviour at the default canvas is preserved).
  Multipliers are clamped to `[0.55, 1.9]` to keep thumbnails and
  posters legible. See the new `R/visual-scale.R`.
- New `scaling = "fixed"` mode on
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) — and
  corresponding global option `options(cograph.visual_scaling = FALSE)`
  — disables device compensation for reproducibility-sensitive workflows
  that calibrated against the previous behaviour.
- [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) return
  value now carries two attributes for downstream tooling:
  `cograph.visual_scale` (the multiplier list) and
  `cograph.node_diam_in` (the representative node diameter in inches at
  the rendered device).
- The splot-internal
  [`render_legend_splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/render_legend_splot.md)
  plus the new shared `.render_legend_base()`
  (`R/render-legend-shared.R`) replace the ad-hoc legend cex/pt.cex
  handling with a single compensated path. `plot_htna`, `plot_mtna`,
  `plot_mlna`, `plot_mcml` still use their historical scale multiplier
  arguments; Phase 2 will migrate them to the shared helper.

### Plotting

- `splot.netobject` now routes on the Nestimate `$method` slot rather
  than just direction. Undirected sequence-based networks from
  [`build_cna()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/Nestimate/man/build_cna.html) and
  `wtna(method = "cooccurrence")` get oval TNA-family styling (layout,
  palette, donuts) with arrows and dotted edge starts automatically
  dropped because the matrix is symmetric. Glasso / cor / pcor / ising
  networks still get `psych_styling = TRUE` (spring layout, Okabe-Ito
  palette).
- [`from_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/from_tna.md)
  auto-detects integer-valued weight matrices (ftna, ctna, raw counts)
  and sets `weight_digits = edge_label_digits = 0` so edge labels render
  as `2304` rather than `2304.00`. Fractional weights still format to
  two decimals. Explicit user-supplied `weight_digits` still wins.
- `psych_styling = TRUE` is now exported as a first-class styling preset
  (undirected counterpart of `tna_styling`) — Okabe-Ito palette, spring
  layout, no arrows — applied by default to `splot.netobject` on
  correlation-family input and to the `$contemporaneous` / `$between`
  constituents of `net_mlvar`.
- Expanded [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md)
  dispatch coverage across the tna and Nestimate class hierarchies,
  ensuring `tna`, `ftna`, `ctna`, `group_tna`, `tna_bootstrap`,
  `group_tna_bootstrap`, `tna_permutation`, `group_tna_permutation`,
  `netobject`, `netobject_group`, `netobject_ml`, `net_mlvar`,
  `wtna_mixed`, `net_bootstrap`, `net_permutation`, `boot_glasso`,
  `mcml`, `net_hon`, `net_hypa`, and `simplicial_complex` all reach the
  correct renderer.
- Self-loops are now preserved in every plot function.

### Correctness fixes (audit-driven)

- [`detect_duplicate_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/detect_duplicate_edges.md),
  [`aggregate_duplicate_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/aggregate_duplicate_edges.md),
  [`simplify.cograph_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/simplify.md),
  and the internal
  [`check_duplicate_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/check_duplicate_edges.md)
  helper now respect directed vs undirected semantics. Previously the
  canonical (min/max) endpoint key collapsed `A -> B` and `B -> A` into
  one edge even on directed graphs, matching
  [`igraph::simplify()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/simplify.html)
  ground truth.
- [`.compute_modularity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/dot-compute_modularity.md)
  replaces a nested for loop with cluster-wise vectorization
  (`sum(A[idx, idx]) - sum(k_out[idx]) * sum(k_in[idx]) / m`), per the
  project “no for loops” rule. Results verified bit-exact against
  [`igraph::modularity()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/modularity.igraph.html).
- [`is_directed()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/is_directed.md)
  now recognises `CographNetwork` R6 objects — previously only the
  `cograph_network` list format dispatched correctly.
- `compute_layout_for_cograph()` uses `layout$get_type()` instead of the
  removed `$name` field on `CographLayout`.
- [`network_small_world()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_small_world.md)
  returns `0` (valid: no triangles means definitively not small-world)
  instead of `NA_real_` when the observed clustering coefficient is zero
  but path length is finite.
- [`simplify.cograph_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/simplify.md)
  threads the directed flag through to edge aggregation so directed
  multigraphs collapse correctly.

### Performance & documentation

- [`simplify()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/simplify.md)
  performance refactor for large networks plus a cleaner
  title-composition path.
- [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md),
  [`extract_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_motifs.md),
  and `plot.cograph_motif_analysis` examples reworked to use
  `n_perm = 10L` (or `significance = FALSE`) and promoted from
  `\dontrun` to CRAN-runnable (optional tna branches stay in
  `\donttest`). Retires 320 seconds of latent CRAN timing risk — every
  example now runs in under 4 seconds.

### New tests

- `test-audit-fixes.R` — ground-truth regressions for the directed edge
  semantics, modularity vectorization, and small-world behaviour
  changes.
- `test-integer-weight-labels.R` — locks
  [`from_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/from_tna.md)
  integer-weight auto-detect behaviour and precedence of explicit
  `weight_digits`.
- `test-equiv-{assortativity, cluster-quality, communities, disparity, edge-centrality, network-summary, robustness, standalone-measures}.R`
  — numerical equivalence against igraph, sna, centiserve, brainGraph,
  influenceR, tidygraph, and NetworkX. Gated by
  `skip_coverage_tests() + skip_on_cran()`, so they do not run on the
  CRAN pipeline.

## cograph 2.1.0

### New Features

#### Batch 6 — new-API graph-level / set-level / pair-level measures

These measures don’t fit the per-node
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
data frame, so they live as standalone functions:

- [`estrada_index()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/estrada_index.md)
  — graph-level spectral invariant: , equal to the trace of the matrix
  exponential of the adjacency. Equivalently, the sum of
  `subgraph_centrality()` across all nodes. Matches
  `networkx.estrada_index` at machine epsilon (max relative diff ~5e-15
  across random test graphs).
- [`trophic_incoherence()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/trophic_incoherence.md)
  — graph-level food-web stability measure (Johnson et al. 2014).
  Defined as the population standard deviation of per-edge trophic
  differences where is the trophic level of node . Zero for perfectly
  coherent DAGs (e.g., a pure chain). Matches
  `networkx.trophic_incoherence_parameter` at machine epsilon.
  Directed-only; reuses the existing `trophic_level` calculator.
- `group_centrality(x, nodes, measure = c("betweenness", "closeness", "degree"))`
  — Everett-Borgatti (1999) group centrality for a *set* of nodes.
  Returns a scalar. Supports `mode = "in"/"out"` for directed-degree
  variants. **Group closeness and group degree** match
  `networkx.group_*_centrality` bit-exact. **Group betweenness**
  implements the textbook Everett-Borgatti / Puzis 2008 definition
  (fraction of shortest paths passing through at least one node in the
  group), which diverges from `networkx.group_betweenness_centrality` on
  some graphs due to a known quirk in NetworkX’s Puzis-Yahalom-Elovici
  iterative algorithm. Verified via an independent Python brute-force:
  cograph matches the textbook definition; NX produces larger values on
  graphs with many overlapping shortest paths. Documented in the roxygen
  “Divergence from NetworkX” section.
- `dispersion(x, u = NULL, v = NULL, normalized = TRUE, alpha = 1, b = 0, c = 0)`
  — Backstrom-Kleinberg (2014 Facebook) pair-level measure of tie
  strength. Counts the number of “well-dispersed” mutual friends of `u`
  and `v` (pairs of common neighbors that are not directly connected and
  share no common neighbor inside `u`’s ego network other than `u` and
  `v`). Matches `networkx.dispersion` bit-exact across all 156 edges on
  the karate club graph. Returns a scalar, named vector, or data frame
  depending on which of `u`, `v` are specified.

#### Centrality Batch 5 — Gould-Fernandez brokerage (5 roles)

Added the five Gould-Fernandez (1989) brokerage role counts, a
foundational measure in social network analysis (~1500 citations). Each
role is a separate per-node measure requiring a `membership` argument
(following the same pattern as `participation`, `within_module_z`,
`gateway`), and counts open directed 2-paths `a -> v -> c` through
broker `v`:

- [`centrality_brokerage_coordinator()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_coordinator.md)
  — all three in broker’s group (w_I)
- [`centrality_brokerage_itinerant()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_itinerant.md)
  — endpoints same group, broker different (w_O, “consultant”)
- [`centrality_brokerage_representative()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_representative.md)
  — broker + source same, target different (b_IO)
- [`centrality_brokerage_gatekeeper()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_gatekeeper.md)
  — broker + target same, source different (b_OI)
- [`centrality_brokerage_liaison()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_liaison.md)
  — all three in different groups (b_O)

Bit-exact match against `sna::brokerage$raw.nli` for all five roles
across 20 random directed graphs. Implemented natively (no runtime
dependency on sna). Key implementation detail: the Gould-Fernandez
counting rule requires **open 2-paths only** — triads where a direct
edge `a -> c` already exists are excluded. This matches sna’s C
implementation exactly and was derived empirically (sna’s
`.C("brokerage_R", ...)` has no R-level source).

Directed-only; warns and returns `NA` on undirected input.

#### Centrality Batch 4 — directed prestige family (Wasserman-Faust / sna)

- [`centrality_prestige_domain()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_prestige_domain.md)
  — directed-graph prestige measure: for each node , the number of other
  nodes that can reach via a directed path. Classical
  Wasserman-Faust (1994) measure from `sna::prestige(cmode = "domain")`.
  Bit-exact match against sna, implemented natively via
  `igraph::distances(mode = "out")` + `colSums(is.finite(D)) - 1` (no
  runtime dependency on sna). Directed-only; returns NA with a warning
  on undirected input.
- [`centrality_prestige_domain_proximity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_prestige_domain_proximity.md)
  — distance-weighted variant: `R_v^2 / (D_v * (n - 1))` where `R_v` is
  the number of reachers and `D_v` is the sum of their geodesic
  distances to `v`. Bit-exact match against
  `sna::prestige(cmode = "domain.proximity")` on strongly connected
  directed graphs. On graphs with any unreachable pair, sna has a known
  bug (`FALSE * Inf = NaN` collapses the denominator, producing all-zero
  output); cograph’s
  [`is.finite()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/is.finite.html)-masked formula
  produces mathematically correct values on any directed graph.
  Directed-only.

#### Centrality Batch 3 — classical measures with reference-package validation

- [`centrality_katz()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_katz.md)
  — Katz (1953) status index. Bit-exact match against
  [`centiserve::katzcent`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/katzcent.html)
  (cograph mirrors centiserve’s exact LAPACK call sequence). Also
  matches `igraph::alpha_centrality(exo = 1)` and
  `networkx.katz_centrality_numpy` at machine epsilon. New `katz_alpha`
  parameter (default 0.1).
- [`centrality_hubbell()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_hubbell.md)
  — Hubbell (1965) input-output centrality. Bit-exact match against
  [`centiserve::hubbell`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/hubbell.html)
  (cograph mirrors centiserve’s full-inverse LAPACK call path). Note:
  centiserve’s default (`weights = NULL`) silently ignores
  `E(g)$weight`; to reproduce cograph’s behavior with centiserve on
  weighted graphs, pass `weights = igraph::E(g)$weight` explicitly. New
  `hubbell_weight` parameter (default 0.5).
- [`centrality_information()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_information.md)
  — Stephenson-Zelen (1989) information centrality. Bit-exact match
  against [`sna::infocent`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sna/man/infocent.html)
  on connected undirected graphs (cograph mirrors sna’s exact
  construction and [`solve()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/solve.html) call
  sequence).
- [`centrality_pairwisedis()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_pairwisedis.md)
  — Pairwise disconnectivity (Potapov et al. 2008). Directed-only;
  fraction of reachable ordered pairs that become unreachable when each
  node is removed. Bit-exact match against
  [`centiserve::pairwisedis`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/pairwisedis.html).
  Warns and returns `NA` on undirected input, matching the convention
  used by `salsa`, `leaderrank`, and `trophic_level`.
- [`centrality_reaching_local()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_reaching_local.md)
  /
  [`reaching_global()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/reaching_global.md)
  — Local and global reaching centrality (Mones, Vicsek & Vicsek 2012).
  Bit-exact match against `networkx.local_reaching_centrality` across
  the directed unweighted, undirected unweighted, and weighted branches.
  Undirected unweighted LRC coincides with
  `igraph::harmonic_centrality(normalized = TRUE)` (documented).
  [`reaching_global()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/reaching_global.md)
  is a graph-level hierarchy statistic in \[0, 1\].

## cograph 1.8.2

### New Features

- [`plot_simplicial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_simplicial.md)
  now accepts `tna`, `netobject`, `net_hon`, and `net_hypa` objects
  directly — higher-order pathways are auto-built and visualized with
  proper state labels, no manual extraction needed. New parameters:
  `method` (`"hon"` / `"hypa"`), `max_pathways`, `ncol`. Dismantled mode
  uses `gridExtra` grid layout with scaled nodes
- [`print.cograph_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/print.cograph_network.md)
  now shows a structured summary: node/edge counts, density,
  reciprocity, weight range, and top-degree nodes — replacing the
  minimal R6 default output
- Added `mcml` S3 class with
  [`as_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/as_mcml.md)
  generic for type-safe handling of Markov Chain Multi-Level models —
  enables [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html),
  [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html), and method
  dispatch on MCML objects
- Added local `%||%` operator for R 4.1 compatibility (no longer
  requires R 4.4+)

### Breaking Changes

- MCML field names renamed for clarity: `$between` → `$macro`, `$within`
  → `$clusters`
- [`as_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/as_tna.md) on MCML
  objects now returns a flat `group_tna` list instead of a nested
  structure

### Bug Fixes

- [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  now suppresses zero-weight edges instead of drawing invisible lines,
  and strips leading zeros from edge labels (`.32` instead of `0.32`)
- Self-loops in
  [`cluster_summary()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/cluster_summary.md)
  are now preserved in the macro diagonal, reflecting intra-cluster
  retention rates
- Sequence data is properly propagated through the full tna → macro →
  cluster pipeline, so downstream models can use bootstrap and
  permutation tests

## cograph 1.8.0

### New Features

- Added
  [`overlay_communities()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/overlay_communities.md)
  for drawing community blob overlays on any network plot — accepts
  method names, membership vectors, or pre-computed community objects

  for higher-order pathway visualization, rendering simplicial complexes
  as smooth blobs with flexible separators and a dismantled view option
- Added `value_nudge` parameter to
  [`plot_transitions()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_transitions.md)
  for controlling the distance between flow labels and nodes
- Added bundle legend label controls: `bundle_legend_size`,
  `bundle_legend_color`, `bundle_legend_fontface`,
  `bundle_legend_position`
- Added per-function label controls (`label_size`, `label_color`,
  `label_fontface`, `label_hjust`) to
  [`plot_transitions()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_transitions.md),
  [`plot_trajectories()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_trajectories.md),
  and
  [`plot_alluvial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_alluvial.md)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed spiky text halo artifacts in transition and heatmap plots by
  increasing circular offset directions from 8 to 16 (22.5° spacing for
  smooth outlines)

- Added
  [`robustness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/robustness.md)
  for network robustness analysis with targeted (betweenness, degree)
  and random attack strategies, plus
  [`ggplot_robustness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/ggplot_robustness.md)

- Added `temporal_edge_list()` for converting sequence data to
  timestamped edge lists
- Added

- Added
  [`verify_with_igraph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/verify_with_igraph.md)
  for cross-validating cograph centrality and network metrics against
  igraph

#### Motif Analysis

- Added [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md) /
  [`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md) as
  a unified API for triad census (node-exchangeable counts) and instance
  extraction (named node triples), with auto-detection of actor/session
  columns, rolling/tumbling window support, and exact configuration
  model significance testing

  self-loops, and 22 customization parameters
- Added
  [`plot_chord()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_chord.md)
  for native chord diagrams with automatic weight-based arc sizing
- Added `plot_time_line()` for cluster membership timeline visualization
- Added
  [`plot_htna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_htna.md)
  orientations: `"facing"` (tip-to-tip columns) and `"circular"` (two
  semicircles), plus `intra_curvature` for drawing intra-group edges as
  dotted bezier arcs
- Added `threshold` parameter to all plot functions for filtering
  edges/cells below a minimum absolute weight
- Added `value_fontface`, `value_fontfamily`, and `value_halo`
  parameters to
  [`plot_heatmap()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_heatmap.md)
  for text styling control
- Added directional shorthands for `scale_nodes_by`: `indegree`,
  `outdegree`, `instrength`, `outstrength`, `incloseness`,
  `outcloseness`, `inharmonic`, `outharmonic`, `ineccentricity`,
  `outeccentricity`
- Added `scale_nodes_scale` parameter to
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) for
  dampening (\< 1) or exaggerating (\> 1) centrality-based node sizing
  differences
- Added qgraph argument translation in
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md): when
  plotting tna objects, qgraph-style parameters (`vsize`, `asize`,
  `edge.color`, `lty`, `shape`) are automatically mapped to cograph
  equivalents

#### Transition Plot Enhancements

- Added intermediate labels with `node_label_format` (e.g.,
  `"{state} (n={count})"`) for showing counts on transition plot nodes
- Added line bundling via `bundle_size` for aggregating individual
  trajectories into weighted summary lines in large datasets
- Added flow value labels via `show_values` / `value_position` for
  displaying transition counts on flow lines
- Added `label_position` consistency across ALL columns (first, middle,
  last) in trajectory plots

#### Data & Infrastructure

- Added example datasets: `gamer_data`, `group_engagement`, `srl_data`
- Added `set_node_groups()` / `get_node_groups()` for managing cluster
  assignments on cograph_network objects
- Consolidated cograph_network metadata under `$meta` with getter/setter
  functions
- Added `group_tna` support to
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) for direct
  plotting of grouped TNA models
- Gave each `centrality_*` wrapper its own focused help page

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed load and percolation centrality computation: the BFS assumed
  unit edge weights, causing infinite loops on weighted graphs; directed
  graphs now transpose correctly (matching sna convention); disconnected
  nodes no longer contribute spurious centrality
- Fixed self-loop and edge clipping in
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) viewport
  calculation
- Fixed argument forwarding in splot dispatch for bootstrap/permutation
  objects — named parameters (minimum, threshold, layout, title) were
  consumed by
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md)’s
  signature and silently dropped when dispatching
- Fixed overlapping flow value labels in multi-step alluvial plots
- Fixed alluvial label halo rendering producing spike artifacts (8 → 16
  offset directions)
- Fixed viridis palette direction in
  [`plot_heatmap()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_heatmap.md)
  so high values get dark colors
- Fixed
  [`build_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/build_mcml.md)
  density method crash when weight vector had no names
- Fixed display label priority resolution (labels \> label \>
  identifier)
- Removed zero-value labels that appeared after rounding in transition
  plots

### Improvements

- Simplified splot dispatch: extracted `.collect_dispatch_args()` helper
  to replace 6 copy-paste dispatch blocks, using
  [`match.call()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.call.html) +
  [`mget()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/get.html) for reliable argument
  capture

## cograph 1.6.0

    used `x`

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed [`tplot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_tna.md)
  default margins causing tiny plots compared to
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md)

### Documentation

- Added qgraph to splot migration guide (`vignettes/qgraph-to-splot.md`)

## cograph 1.5.1

### Breaking Changes (with backwards compatibility)

The following parameters have been renamed for consistency. The old
