# Changelog

## cograph 2.6.10

### `plot_htna()` gains `legend_size`, and its legend is no longer oversized

The “Groups” legend was drawn at a hard-coded `cex = 1.4` – larger than
the node labels it explains – with no argument to change it.
[`plot_htna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_htna.md) now
takes `legend_size` (a `cex`, default `0.8`, the same default and
meaning as `splot(legend_size = )`), and the legend’s symbols are sized
from it. **The default legend is therefore visibly smaller than in
2.6.9**; pass `legend_size = 1.4` for the old text size. Anything other
than a single positive number raises a `cograph_bad_legend_size` error.

### Bug fix: the `plot_htna()` legend overlapped the network and was cut off

With a side legend (`legend_position = "bottom"`, the default, or
`"top"`, `"left"`, `"right"`), the “Groups” legend was drawn partly on
top of the network and partly off the page, at every figure size. Two
causes:

- [`plot_htna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_htna.md)
  reserved the legend’s margin with `par(mar = )`, which
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) replaces
  with its own `margins` before drawing. The margin now travels as
  `splot(margins = )`, so the band the legend needs really exists.
- The legend was pushed out of the plot with a negative `inset`, which
  is a fraction of the plot region and moves the box by only a sliver of
  its own height. The legend is now measured first and anchored by
  coordinates in the centre of its band.

The band is sized from the legend itself (rows, title, longest group
name, `legend_size`, and the device’s text scale) rather than a fixed
6.5 lines. If a legend still cannot fit – many long group names on a
small figure – it is scaled down instead of overlapping the plot or
leaving the page.

A margin passed explicitly (`mar =` or `margins =`) is left untouched.
With `legend_position = "top"` and a `title`, the title is drawn on the
outer lines of the top margin and the legend below it; previously
[`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) centred the
title in that margin, on top of the legend. Corner positions
(`"topright"` etc.) are unchanged and still draw inside the plot box.

## cograph 2.6.9

### A full audit of the reference manual

Every exported and internal function was read against its own roxygen
block. Everything below is a documentation correction unless a heading
says otherwise.

#### Examples no longer assume a suggested package is installed

`igraph` is in `Suggests`, but examples throughout the manual failed
without it. 78 roxygen example blocks are now
`@examplesIf requireNamespace("igraph", quietly = TRUE)`.

Most built their example network with
[`igraph::make_ring()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/make_ring.html),
[`igraph::make_star()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/make_star.html)
or `igraph::make_graph("Zachary")` and were found by reading the
examples. The last 21 were not:
[`network_summary()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_summary.md),
[`network_girth()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_girth.md),
[`network_radius()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_radius.md),
[`degree_distribution()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/degree_distribution.md),
[`dyad_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/dyad_census.md),
[`ego_networks()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/ego_networks.md),
[`shortest_paths()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/shortest_paths.md)
and the rest of that family take a plain matrix and reach igraph
internally through
[`to_igraph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_igraph.md), so
nothing in the example text revealed the dependency. They were found by
removing igraph and running the manual.

Verified by running every example in a library where `igraph` (and
therefore `tna`) could not be loaded: 403 topics, no failures.

#### `...` documented an argument that could not be passed

32 verbs – the community detection family, the `network_*` summaries,
[`assortativity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/assortativity.md),
[`core_periphery()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/core_periphery.md),
[`dyad_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/dyad_census.md),
[`ego_networks()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/ego_networks.md),
[`shortest_paths()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/shortest_paths.md),
[`k_shortest_paths()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/k_shortest_paths.md),
[`rich_club()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/rich_club.md),
[`rich_club_local()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/rich_club_local.md),
[`robustness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/robustness.md)
and
[`vulnerability()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/vulnerability.md)
– documented `...` as “additional arguments passed to
[`to_igraph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_igraph.md)”.
[`to_igraph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_igraph.md) is
`function(x, directed = NULL)`: it has no `...`, so anything passed
raised an “unused argument” error. Each site now says what is true.
Where `directed` is already an explicit formal the dots are documented
as unused; where it is not, they are documented as carrying `directed`
and nothing else.

#### A lost title, a lost contract

[`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)’s
title line was missing its leading `#`, so R parsed it as a stray
top-level string and roxygen took the next ten lines of prose as the
title. `man/plot_mcml.Rd` now has the title it was meant to have.

A roxygen block in `blob-helpers.R` had been separated from its function
by a later comment banner, which silently moved
`.expand_repeated_nodes()`’s `@param` and `@return` onto the one-line
accessor that followed it.

#### Corrections to documented behaviour

Among the factual fixes:
[`core_periphery()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/core_periphery.md)’s
example printed a component that does not exist;
[`network_global_efficiency()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_global_efficiency.md)
documented the wrong value for its own example;
[`community_consensus()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/community_consensus.md)
documented `...` as reaching the detection method when it is discarded;
[`degree_distribution()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/degree_distribution.md)
marked three always-present components as conditional;
`binarize(signed = TRUE)` was described as producing `-1` rather than
`+1` or `-1`;
[`get_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/get_edges.md) did
not say its `from`/`to` are integer indices rather than labels; several
verbs did not name the classed condition they raise; and the
[`register_shape()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/register_shape.md)
and
[`register_layout()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/register_layout.md)
examples overwrote a built-in shape and layout for the rest of the
session. `show_zero_edges` in
[`from_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/from_tna.md) and
[`from_qgraph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/from_qgraph.md)
is documented as having no effect, which is what it has.

The [`plot_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_tna.md)
example that demonstrated custom colours with `rainbow(5)` now uses
`palette_colorblind(5)`: the reference manual was teaching the one
palette the package’s own style rules exclude.

British spellings in roxygen prose were normalized to the `en-US` that
`DESCRIPTION` declares (513 words across 79 files; comments only).

### One fewer dependency

`scales` has been dropped from `Suggests`. It was used for exactly one
call – [`scales::squish`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/oob.html)
as the out-of-bounds handler on the centrality heatmap’s fill scale –
and that behaviour is now a nine-line base R helper. Clamping is
unchanged: a finite value outside the limits is pulled to the nearer
end, and `NA` and the infinities are left alone.

### `show_zero_edges` now does something

[`from_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/from_tna.md) and
[`from_qgraph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/from_qgraph.md)
have accepted and documented a `show_zero_edges` argument for several
releases without ever reading it. Zero is how a weight matrix stores “no
edge”, so an edge whose weight rounds to zero at `weight_digits`
disappears from the plot, and there was no way to prevent that. With
`show_zero_edges = TRUE` such an edge is now drawn at the smallest
magnitude `weight_digits` can express, carrying its sign; every other
weight is untouched. The default, `FALSE`, behaves exactly as before.

### Three parameters now say what is wrong with them

`ld_radius`, `s_shell_a` and `comm_r` were unvalidated, so a value
outside their domain surfaced as an opaque failure from deep inside a
kernel – `values must be length 1, but FUN(X[[1]]) result is length 0`
for `ld_radius = 0`, and an all-`NA` result with a coercion warning for
a `comm_r` that is neither `"max_intra"` nor a number. All three now
raise a classed `cograph_bad_parameter` error naming the argument and
its domain, matching the other tuning parameters in the centrality
surface.

### Two regressions against reverse dependencies

Both were introduced before this release and are found by checking
cograph against the eight packages that depend on it. All eight now
check identically against this version and against the current CRAN
cograph.

[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
failed with *arguments imply differing number of rows* on a network
whose node table carries no `label` column. The node-label fallback
tested only for `NULL`, and a source with no labels arrives as a
zero-length character vector instead, so the fallback to node indices
never fired and the `node` column came out empty beside full-length
measure columns. The fallback now checks that there is exactly one label
per node, which also rejects a label vector of the wrong length.

[`to_df()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_data_frame.md) and
[`to_data_frame()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_data_frame.md)
return `from`, `to` and `weight` again. When these stopped routing
through igraph, the round-trip that used to discard extra edge columns
went with it, and the verb silently began returning every column the
edge table carried. They are the narrow conversion verbs; to get the
edge table whole – including columns
[`mutate_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/mutate_edges.md)
computed – use
[`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html) on the
network, which is the accessor and is unchanged.

### Fixes

`centrality(measures = "hubbell")` refused to report a divergent result
only when the largest *real part* of the scaled spectrum reached 1. The
Neumann series behind Hubbell diverges once the *spectral radius* does,
so a signed network carrying a complex pair of modulus above 1 – or a
real eigenvalue below -1 – was reported as a confident number instead of
`NA`. The guard now tests the modulus. For a non-negative weight matrix
the Perron root is real, positive and equal to the spectral radius, so
no unsigned network changes.

`centrality(measures = "delta_closeness", closeness_delta = 0)` scored
every node of a disconnected graph 1. R evaluates `Inf^0` as `1` and
`is.finite(1)` is `TRUE`, so an unreachable pair passed the filter and
counted as fully close. The distance matrix is now screened as well.
Only `closeness_delta = 0` is affected; every positive delta already
behaved.

[`centrality_expected_influence_1()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_expected_influence_1.md)
and
[`centrality_expected_influence_2()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_expected_influence_2.md)
read their result column by `$` partial matching, because the column is
really `expected_influence_1_out`. They now index the column by name.
Results are unchanged.

[`mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/mcml.md)’s deprecation
marker no longer depends on the `lifecycle` package, which was not
declared anywhere, and no longer points at an SVG that the package does
not ship – the HTML help image for that topic was broken.

## cograph 2.6.5

### Direction cues on simplicial pathway panels

A simplex is a set of vertices, so a blob on its own cannot say which
state came first: `A -> B -> B` and `B -> A -> B` drew the identical
shape. With `dismantled = TRUE` each panel shows one ordered pathway, so
[`plot_simplicial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_simplicial.md)
can now draw the traversal three ways, selected with `direction_cues`: a
light-to-dark core ramp along the path (`"shade"`), a ring whose
highlight peaks on the side facing the next state (`"ring"`), and an
arrowhead just outside each node aimed at its successor (`"arrows"`).

`direction` defaults to `NULL`, which turns the cues on exactly when
`dismantled = TRUE`. A single combined blob cannot express direction, so
`direction = TRUE` with `dismantled = FALSE` raises a classed
`cograph_direction_needs_panels` error rather than drawing a misleading
figure. `legend` draws the in-figure legend strip beneath a dismantled
grid and defaults to `TRUE` whenever the cues are on.

### Unordered pathways are no longer forced into a source/target split

An association-rule itemset and a clique of a simplicial complex are
sets: every member is co-equal and there is no target at all. These are
now carried through the pipeline as genuinely unordered —
`ordered = FALSE` — instead of having a source/target split imposed on
them, and their panels are titled with a member list rather than a path.
Ordered HON/HYPA/MOGen pathways are unaffected.

### Fixes

A panel-centring clip that could cut a blob off at the panel edge is
fixed, and an NSE-related `R CMD check` NOTE is resolved.

## cograph 2.6.4

### Fixes to the parallel motif null

A permutation replicate that does not come back intact from a parallel
worker now raises an error. Previously only an explicit worker error was
caught; a worker killed by the operating system returns `NULL` for its
whole chunk with only a warning, and those gaps were silently filled by
recycling the surviving replicates – part of a permutation null replaced
by duplicates, with no warning and no error.

The serial replicate path no longer leaves the session’s random number
generator switched to L’Ecuyer-CMRG.
[`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md) itself
never used that path, but the package’s own test suite did, which
changed the random fixtures of every test file that ran afterwards.

`cores` validation now raises a classed `cograph_bad_cores` condition.

## cograph 2.6.3

### Clearer errors when igraph is not installed

igraph is a suggested dependency. Functions that need it – including
[`to_igraph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_igraph.md),
[`motif_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motif_census.md),
[`detect_communities()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/detect_communities.md),
[`robustness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/robustness.md),
[`vulnerability()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/vulnerability.md),
[`rich_club()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/rich_club.md) and
[`network_summary()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_summary.md)
– now raise a `cograph_missing_suggest` error naming the function and
how to install igraph, instead of R’s bare “there is no package called
‘igraph’”. Functions that need no igraph, such as
`motifs(significance = FALSE)`,
[`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md),
[`extract_triads()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_triads.md)
and
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md),
keep working without it.

### Faster motif permutation tests

[`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md) on
individual-level data (a `tna` model, or an edge list with an actor
column) now runs its permutation null several times faster — on
[`tna::group_regulation`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/group_regulation.md)
with the default `n_perm = 1000`, 255s to 39s. The null builds class
counts directly instead of materialising and then re-counting a row per
node triple, and the triple indices are computed once per state space
rather than once per unit per replicate.

Results are unchanged: for a given `seed` the permutation draws, and
every count, expectation, z score and p value, are identical to previous
versions.

### Faster `extract_motifs(significance = TRUE)`

The instance-level permutation null now counts (triple, class) pairs
directly instead of building a labelled row per triple per unit and
re-aggregating it by a pasted key. On
[`tna::group_regulation`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/group_regulation.md)
at `n_perm = 1000`, 428s to 32s. Results are unchanged for a given
`seed`.

### `motifs(cores = )`

The individual-level permutation null can now run across worker
processes. `cores = 1` remains the default and is byte-for-byte the
previous behaviour.

`cores > 1` gives each replicate its own L’Ecuyer-CMRG stream, so a
result depends on `seed` alone – not on the worker count, and not on how
replicates were chunked across workers. Repeated parallel runs of one
seed agree exactly, at any `cores`. Those are a different set of draws
from the serial path, so p-values from `cores > 1` will not match a
`cores = 1` run of the same seed; both are valid permutation nulls.
Forking is used where available, with a PSOCK cluster on Windows.

Measured on 10,000 simulated sequences (10 states) at `n_perm = 400`:
103.0s at `cores = 1`, 20.5s at `cores = 10`.

On Windows the null runs through a PSOCK cluster, which is exercised in
the test suite on every platform.

A replicate that does not come back intact from a worker – an error, a
NULL from a killed process, or a wrong-length result – raises a
`cograph_parallel_failure` error naming the problem, rather than being
folded into the null matrix. If the available core count cannot be
detected, `cores > 1` is used but reported with a
`cograph_cores_undetected` warning.

### `plot_mcml(expand = )`

The top layer can now be drawn at a finer resolution than the partition:
named clusters appear as their member states while every other cluster
stays a single node, and the bottom layer still shows the partition, so
an expanded state sits inside its cluster’s shell and is linked to its
own summary node. `expand = "all"` (or `TRUE`) expands every cluster.

The expanded macro is re-counted from the input with a refined
partition, using cograph’s own
[`cluster_summary()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_summary.html);
a k x k aggregate cannot be disaggregated after the fact. Only a
pre-built `cluster_summary` or `mcml`, which carries no source to
re-count from, falls back to `Nestimate::macro_network()`, and says so
with a `cograph_expand_unavailable` error when that is unavailable.

This also fixes a silent defect in the previous layout code: the top
layer was indexed positionally against the cluster count, so a macro
with more nodes than the partition was truncated to its first *k* rows
and drawn under the cluster names — a confident, wrong figure with no
error. It is now matched by name, and a macro wider than the partition
that cograph did not build itself is refused.

## cograph 2.6.1

Fixes for defects an adversarial review found in the 2.6.0 wrangling
verbs. All of them were introduced in 2.6.0 except the last, which was
older.

### Signed weights are no longer deleted

Zero is how cograph stores “no edge”, so it must never be compared
against a real weight.
[`to_undirected()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_undirected.md),
[`symmetrize()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/symmetrize.md),
[`spanning_tree()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/spanning_tree.md)
and
[`bind_networks()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/bind_networks.md)
did exactly that, which silently deleted edges in networks that carry
negative weights — correlation and partial-correlation networks above
all:

- a one-way edge of weight `-2` was deleted by `method = "max"`, because
  `pmax(-2, 0)` is `0`;
- a one-way edge of weight `2` was deleted by `method = "min"`;
- `method = "mean"` halved every unreciprocated edge against a phantom
  reverse arc;
- [`spanning_tree()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/spanning_tree.md)
  returned an empty network on any all-negative graph: Prim chose the
  right edges, then the mirroring step compared each against zero and
  erased it;
- `bind_networks(weight = "max")` lost an edge only one network had if
  its weight was negative.

Presence is now carried separately from weight throughout: two values
are combined only where both arcs exist, and an unreciprocated edge
keeps its own weight. Combining to exactly zero raises a
`cograph_edges_dropped` warning rather than shrinking the edge set in
silence.

[`symmetrize()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/symmetrize.md)
gains `method = "mutual"` for the reciprocated-only rule (sna’s
“strong”). `method = "min"` no longer means that: it is a weight
combination that keeps unreciprocated edges, which is a different
operation.

### Other fixes

- [`contract_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/contract_nodes.md)
  counted an undirected within-group edge twice, because a symmetric
  matrix holds every such edge twice. It now aggregates the edge table,
  so a single edge of weight 3 becomes a self-loop of 3, not 6.
- [`reorder_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/reorder_nodes.md)
  checked only the length of `order`, so a non-permutation such as
  `c("A", "A", "B")` produced duplicate labels or an internal subscript
  error. It now requires an exact permutation.
- [`add_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/add_edges.md)
  and
  [`set_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/set_edges.md)
  accepted the same undirected edge twice (`A->B` and `B->A`), leaving
  the edge table and the weight matrix disagreeing about how many edges
  exist. Both now reject it.
- [`mutate_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/mutate_nodes.md)
  and
  [`mutate_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/mutate_edges.md)
  could overwrite the columns the structure is keyed on (`label`, `id`,
  `from`, `to`), leaving the node table, edge table and matrix
  describing different networks. Those columns are now reserved. A
  weight mutated to zero drops the edge with a classed warning rather
  than leaving a row the matrix does not have.
- Removing every edge now also raises `cograph_isolates_created`, as the
  documented invariant says: the nodes are kept, so they are newly
  isolated.
- [`split_components()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/split_components.md)
  and
  [`contract_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/contract_nodes.md)
  no longer fail on a zero-node network, and the matrix-level verbs
  raise `cograph_bad_selection` on non-finite weights instead of an
  internal error several frames later.
- `proportion` and `density` reject 0, and `top`, `k` and `min_size`
  reject fractional values, as documented.
  [`complement_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/complement_network.md)
  rejects `weight = 0`, which would have produced an empty complement.
- `bind_networks(directed = FALSE)` on directed input returned an
  “undirected” network whose matrix was asymmetric and whose edge table
  was empty; it now symmetrises the inputs first. It also carries `x`’s
  metadata, estimation data and node attributes instead of dropping
  them.
- Empty results keep the estimation data, and
  [`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html) on one
  keeps the extra edge columns.
- [`reverse_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/reverse_edges.md)
  and
  [`normalize_weights()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/normalize_weights.md)
  (`"max"`, `"sum"`, `"minmax"`) keep extra edge columns; they map edges
  one-to-one, so there was no reason to lose them. `network_to_igraph()`
  carries node columns across as vertex attributes, so attributes added
  with
  [`mutate_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/mutate_nodes.md)
  survive `keep_format = TRUE`.
- `parse_matrix()` read an undirected matrix from the strict upper
  triangle, so a self-loop on the diagonal was dropped from the edge
  table while `$weights` kept it — the two disagreed, and a later
  matrix-level verb could resurrect the loop. Undirected self-loops are
  now edges. This predates 2.6.0.

## cograph 2.6.0

### Network wrangling

The verbs that reshape a network are now a family with one contract: any
supported input, options as named arguments, a `cograph_network` back
(or the input format with `keep_format = TRUE`), and classed conditions.
See
[`?network_wrangling`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_wrangling.md).

#### New accessor

[`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html) on a
`cograph_network` returns the tidy edge table, with endpoints as labels
rather than internal indices, and `as.data.frame(what = "nodes")`
returns the node table. No caller needs to reach into the object with
`$` any more.

when igraph is attached.

#### Wider vocabulary inside expressions

Node expressions gain `is_isolated`, `is_source`, `is_sink`, `is_leaf`,
`is_cut`, `local_transitivity` and `local_triangles`, and any measure
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
computes can now be named directly — `select_nodes(x, harmonic > 0)`
works, as does `select_top(x, n = 5, by = "leverage")`. Edge expressions
gain `is_loop`, `is_multiple`, `is_reciprocal`, `weight_rank`,
`from_community` and `to_community`, and `select_edges(by = )` accepts
the endpoint metrics.

#### Bug fixes (all user-visible)

- A network whose last node has no edges no longer crashes
  [`filter_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/filter_nodes.md),
  [`select_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/select_nodes.md),
  [`select_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/select_edges.md),
  [`to_df()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_data_frame.md),
  [`to_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_network.md)
  or
  [`to_igraph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_igraph.md).
  `network_to_igraph()` built the graph from the edge list, so every
  node after the last edge endpoint disappeared and the label assignment
  then failed.
- An undirected network stays undirected through every verb. The rebuilt
  weight matrix was upper-triangular, so
  [`as_cograph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/as_cograph.md)
  re-detected the result as directed and every downstream consumer saw
  half the strength.
- [`set_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/set_edges.md)
  and
  [`set_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/set_nodes.md)
  rebuild the stored weight matrix, so
  [`to_matrix()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_matrix.md)
  can no longer return the pre-edit network, and
  [`set_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/set_edges.md)
  keeps extra edge columns.
- Extra columns of an edge-list input (`session`, `time`, …) survive
  [`as_cograph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/as_cograph.md)
  and are usable in filter expressions, as documented.
- Node groups, estimation data, layout and the original source type
  survive every filter.
- An empty result with `keep_format = TRUE` returns an empty object of
  the input type instead of erroring with “No such edge attribute”.
- `keep_format = TRUE` on a tna model returns a rebuilt tna model.
- [`to_matrix()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_matrix.md)
  and
  [`to_data_frame()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/to_data_frame.md)
  no longer route through igraph.

#### Behaviour changes

- **Filtering edges no longer removes nodes.**
  [`filter_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/filter_edges.md),
  [`select_edges()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/select_edges.md)
  and friends now keep every node, matching
  [`igraph::delete_edges()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/delete_edges.html)
  and tidygraph, and warn (`cograph_isolates_created`) when the filter
  left a node without edges. Use
  [`remove_isolates()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/remove_isolates.md),
  or `keep_isolates = FALSE`, for the old behaviour.
- `.keep_isolates` and `.keep_edges` are renamed to `keep_isolates` and
  `keep_edges`. The dotted names still work and warn.
- Malformed selections are errors of class `cograph_bad_selection`
  rather than warnings that return something plausible: unknown node
  names, out-of-range or fractional indices, a `between` that is not two
  node sets, an unknown measure in `by`.
- The “Result converted to cograph_network” message is gone; the
  conversion is documented instead.
- [`filter_nodes()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/filter_nodes.md)
  computes only the measures its expression names. It used to compute
  all twelve, including HITS, on every call.

## cograph 2.5.0

- `Matrix` is no longer imported (nothing used it after the port); the
  committed test-network fixtures are now tracked; two tests no longer
  need `withr`.

## cograph 2.4.9

### Centrality without igraph

The whole centrality surface
([`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
and its 191 `centrality_*` wrappers,
[`edge_centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/edge_centrality.md),
[`centralization()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centralization.md),
[`group_centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/group_centrality.md),
[`dispersion()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/dispersion.md),
[`estrada_index()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/estrada_index.md),
[`trophic_incoherence()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/trophic_incoherence.md),
and the centrality vocabulary of the wrangling verbs) now computes on
cograph’s own kernels. Every input is turned once into a dense, labelled
weight matrix (`R/kernels-graph.R`); no igraph object is built. igraph
stays in Suggests for input conversion of igraph objects and for
community detection and layouts.

Equivalence was verified measure by measure against the igraph-backed
implementation on a golden corpus of 62 unsigned networks (30 real, 32
synthetic edge cases) under every mode and weighting, at relative
tolerance `sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)`, with the following documented
exceptions.

- `flow_betweenness` still needs igraph and raises
  `cograph_needs_igraph` when it is not installed.
- Hub, authority and eigenvector scores on graphs whose adjacency (or
  `A'A`) is not primitive are not unique; igraph returned a random
  member of the eigenspace and sometimes failed to converge. The native
  kernels are deterministic and verified by eigen-residual tests
  instead.
- Local transitivity and clusterrank on directed graphs with
  reciprocated dyads now follow igraph’s documented semantics (collapse
  to a simple undirected graph). igraph 2.3.3 returned a different value
  after `any_multiple()` had been called on the object, which the old
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  always did.
- `alpha` now computes on weighted graphs with self-loops; igraph 2.3.3
  errored there.
- Path-based measures are now scale-invariant: the same graph with all
  weights multiplied by `1e-18` gives identical betweenness. igraph’s
  absolute epsilon does not.
- Parallel edges are always combined: a dense weight matrix holds one
  value per cell, so `simplify = FALSE` or `"none"` now sum them (the
  old adapters summed them when assembling an adjacency anyway). Only
  `degree` on a multigraph changes, counting a parallel pair once.
- Weighted local reaching centrality averages weights along one shortest
  path per target; among tied shortest paths the kernel’s choice is
  deterministic (lowest predecessor index) where igraph’s was
  implementation-dependent. Values agree exactly whenever no ties exist.
- Weighted (Barrat) transitivity has a native kernel; like igraph it
  refuses directed input, with class `cograph_directed_unsupported`.

New internal kernels: edge betweenness, Barrat transitivity, average
neighbour degree, articulation points, bridges, ego masks, and a
loop-preserving coreness matching igraph’s convention.

Test infrastructure: a versioned corpus of test networks under
`tests/testthat/networks/` (32 real, 35 degenerate, plus local tiers), a
golden-file comparison harness, a scale-invariance property test, and a
CI job that runs the centrality tests with igraph uninstalled.

## cograph 2.4.8

### New features

#### Centrality Batch 51 — trust-PageRank

- Added
  [`centrality_trust_pagerank()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_trust_pagerank.md),
  Sheng, Zhu, Wang, Wang and Hou’s trust-PageRank. PageRank’s even split
  of a node’s score among its neighbours is replaced by a *trust-value*
  mixing a similarity ratio with a degree ratio:
  `T(i,j) = (1-k) s(i,j)/sum_{l in N_j} s(j,l) + k d_i/sum_{l in N_j} d_l`,
  fed to `TPR_i = (1-alpha)/n + alpha sum_{j in N_i} T(i,j) TPR_j`, with
  `s` the fixed point of SimRank restricted to the lines of the graph.
  New parameters `tpr_alpha` (0.85), `tpr_k` (0.85), `tpr_decay` (1),
  `tpr_tol` (1e-14) and `tpr_max_iter` (1000).
- **The Centrality Zoo cites the wrong paper.** Its entry 2.381
  attributes Trust-PageRank to Sheng et al., *Physica A* 541:123262,
  which defines the unrelated global-and-local-structure index of entry
  2.149. The formulas it prints are equations (2), (4), (5), (6) and (7)
  of a different, fully open-access Sheng et al. paper, *Algorithms*
  13(11):280, `doi:10.3390/a13110280`, which is what cograph implements.
  A reader following the Zoo’s reference lands on a different measure.
- **The similarity recursion runs on the lines of the graph only, and
  that is what makes it converge.** Algorithm 1 quantifies over
  *connected* pairs and table 3 marks every non-adjacent cell with a
  dash, so a non-adjacent pair contributes zero rather than the `0.1`
  that initialises the lines. The base case `s(a,a) = 1` is then the
  only inhomogeneous term, and it reaches a line exactly through the
  triangles that line carries, so the recursion contracts even at the
  source’s `C = 1`. Pinning non-adjacent pairs at `0.1` instead
  reproduces neither published fixture.
- **Both published fixtures reproduce.** Table 3 on page 6 prints seven
  similarities, and all seven round to their printed two decimals; its
  `S_v` column is the sum of the paper’s own rounded cells rather than
  the rounded sum, a convention node 5 alone separates. Table 5 on page
  10 prints two top-ten rankings: the karate club’s reproduces in order
  at all ten positions, and the kite’s up to three exact ties forced by
  its own automorphism group.
- **A component with lines but no triangle has no value, and cograph
  returns `NA` there rather than inventing one.** The recursion is then
  homogeneous, its least non-negative fixed point is zero, and the
  similarity ratio is `0/0`. Every path, tree, star, even cycle and
  complete bipartite graph is in that class, and so is the Petersen
  graph. Unlike
  [`centrality_dil()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_dil.md)
  and
  [`centrality_lhc()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_lhc.md),
  the quotient is not determined by its numerator, so the `1/d_j`
  fallback would silently turn the measure into a degree-ratio PageRank
  over the whole class; this follows
  [`centrality_iec()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_iec.md)
  instead. An isolate is *not* in the class and keeps the bare
  `(1 - alpha)/n`.
- **The trust matrix is column-stochastic**, so the scores sum to one on
  a graph without isolates and the iteration count is a convergence
  tolerance rather than a modelling choice. Both recursions stop on a
  *relative* change, because the similarities on one graph span twenty
  orders of magnitude; a recursion still moving at `tpr_max_iter` raises
  `cograph_no_converge`.
- **The source’s claim that its decay constant `C` does not matter is
  false for the converged recursion.** It holds for a homogeneous
  recursion; the base case makes this one affine, so `C` enters the
  resolvent. Moving it from 1 to 0.5 moves the karate club’s similarity
  ratios by up to 0.141.
- Direction, weights, loops and parallel edges are projected onto the
  simple undirected skeleton the source defines on. Marked costly, so
  `type = "all"` excludes it unless asked for.

#### Centrality Batch 50 — degree and importance of lines

- Added
  [`centrality_dil()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_dil.md),
  Liu, Xiong, Shi, Shi and Wang’s degree and importance of lines. A
  node’s degree is corrected by the share it can claim of the importance
  of the lines touching it:
  `I_e(m,n) = (k_m - p - 1)(k_n - p - 1) / (p/2 + 1)` is the importance
  of a line, `p` being the number of triangles carrying it;
  `W(i,j) = I_e(i,j) (k_i - 1)/(k_i + k_j - 2)` is the endpoint’s share
  of it; and `DIL(i) = k_i + sum over the open neighbourhood of W(i,j)`.
  No new parameter.
- **`lambda` is `p/2 + 1`, and a text-layer reading gets it wrong.** The
  stacked fraction extracts from the published PDF as `lambda = 2p + 1`,
  in the original as much as in the Almasi and Hu (2019) reproduction of
  it. The equations were read from 300 dpi page images, and the paper’s
  own worked example settles it in printed prose: at `p = 1` it writes
  `lambda = 1/2 + 1 = 1.5` and `I_e45 = 8/3`.
- **No Zoo divergence.** Unlike several recent batches, Zoo entry 2.62
  transcribes the source correctly, and the original agrees with the
  Almasi and Hu reproduction symbol for symbol — only the symbol names
  differ.
- **All three published fixtures reproduce, 29 printed values in
  total.** Figure 1 on page 210 prints `I_e45 = 9` and `8/3`; figure 2
  on page 211 prints four edge importances and then `L_v2 = 26/9` and
  `L_v5 = 52/15`; and table 3 on page 217 prints a value for all 21
  nodes of the ARPA network. The figure-1 and figure-2 values match as
  exact fractions with no tolerance at all, and all 21 table-3 values
  match under the paper’s own four-decimal rounding, in the descending
  order it prints them. The edge list read off figure 6 is corroborated
  by the paper’s own degree column at all 21 nodes.
- **An isolated pair of nodes is the one undefined split, and it
  resolves.** The share’s denominator `k_i + k_j - 2` vanishes only when
  both degrees are one, and there the line’s importance is exactly zero
  as well, so every admissible share of it gives the same contribution.
  The share is written as zero with the test taken before the division,
  and both nodes score 1. The source is silent on the case; the choice
  follows
  [`centrality_lhc()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_lhc.md),
  not
  [`centrality_iec()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_iec.md),
  and the help page says why.
- **A score is never below its node’s degree**, because `p` can never
  exceed either endpoint’s degree minus one, and the network’s total
  excess over degree is exactly the total importance of its lines — the
  two endpoint shares of a line sum to one. Raw scores are
  component-local: the measure never reaches past a node’s second
  neighbours.
- Direction, weights, loops and parallel edges are projected onto the
  simple undirected skeleton the authors state their domain to be. Not
  costly, so `type = "all"` includes it.

#### Centrality Batch 49 — immediate effects centrality

- Added
  [`centrality_iec()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_iec.md),
  Friedkin’s immediate effects centrality. A node is scored by how
  quickly the rest of the network’s influence reaches it:
  `c_IEC(j) = (n - 1) / sum_{i != j} m_ij`, where
  `M = (I - Z + E Z_dg) diag(1/c)` is the mean first passage time matrix
  of the influence chain `W = A / rowSums(A)`, `c` is `W`’s left
  eigenvector at eigenvalue one and `Z = (I - W + 1 c')^-1` is the
  fundamental matrix. The sum runs *down* column `j`, so a high score
  marks a node the network reaches fast. No new parameter.
- **The influence matrix carries a unit self-loop, and the self-loop is
  load-bearing.** The source sets `a_ii = 1` before row-normalising, a
  construction it attributes to French (1956) and states twice on page
  1494. Its footnote 10 gives the reason — a strong network with
        `w_ii > 0` must be regular, meaning aperiodic — and its footnote
        9 the periodic counterexample a zero diagonal admits.
- **This is not cograph’s
  [`centrality_markov()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_markov.md),
  and the difference is not a rescaling.** The package’s own candidate
  ledger recorded for several rounds that the two differed only in an
  `n` versus `n - 1` numerator. That is wrong: `markov` *also* omits the
  self-loop. The numerator is a constant factor and cannot reorder
  anything; the self-loop can and does. On the five-node star `markov`
  gives `1.25, 0.161, ...` where `iec` gives `0.5, 0.08, ...`, and the
  two rank the nodes differently on 2 of the 21 connected five-node
  graphs. `markov` is unchanged; the two ship side by side, and each
  help page now points at the other.
- **A reducible influence chain is refused, not extended.** Without
  irreducibility the eigenvector of equation (9) has one dimension per
  closed class, so `c` is undetermined and `diag(1/c)` undefined. Worse,
  the closed form does not announce the failure: for `i` and `j` in
  different classes `z_ij = 0`, and equation (11) returns the entirely
  finite `m_ij = z_jj / c_j` where the true mean first passage time is
  infinite. Rather than publish a finite wrong number, `iec` tests the
  chain by boolean closure before any solve and returns `NA` at every
  node with a `cograph_undefined_measure` warning. In practice the
  requirement is a connected undirected graph or a strongly connected
  digraph. A one-node graph is `NA` too, equation (20) dividing by
  `n - 1 = 0`; an empty graph returns no scores.
- Direction is kept, because `W` is a matrix of directed influence and
  row `i` is what actor `i` attends to; there is no in/out/all variant,
  so `mode`, `cutoff` and `invert_weights` are ignored. Weights are
  dropped deliberately — `a_ii = 1` is calibrated against `a_ij = 1`, so
  a rescaling of the weights would silently re-weight each actor’s
  self-reliance against the network — and loops in the input are
  absorbed by the mandated diagonal while parallel edges collapse. The
  measure is marked costly and is therefore held back from
  `type = "all"`.
- **The source prints a complete numerical fixture and all 105 values
  reproduce.** Table 1, pages 1492-1494, gives the measure to three
  decimals for every node of all 21 connected non-isomorphic five-node
  graphs. The published audit enumerates those 21 graphs from scratch,
  recovers each printed row’s node labelling from the table’s own TEC
  and IEC columns, and matches every value exactly against one of two
  stated printing rules rather than against a tolerance: 103 of 105
  under round-half-away-from-zero at three decimals and 2 under
  truncation, the two being the exactly halfway `0.1875` the paper
  prints as `.187`. The 105 printed values of the companion TEC column
  reproduce as well, three of them needing the same truncation rule.

#### Centrality Batch 48 — the Lhc index

- Added
  [`centrality_lhc()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_lhc.md),
  the Lhc index of Wang, Yang, Liu and Ma. A node’s *influence* is
  `C(v) = sum_{u in Phi(v)} k_u (1 + TP(u)) / d^2(uv)`, a sum over the
  ball `Phi(v)` of radius `lhc_radius` in which each member contributes
  its degree, inflated by its share of the network’s triangles,
  discounted by the square of its distance; the index is
  `Lhc(v) = sum_{w in tau(v)} C(w)`, that influence summed over the open
  neighbourhood. The triangle share is `TP(u) = NTS(u) / TNTS` with
  `NTS(u)` the number of triangles containing `u`. New parameter
  `lhc_radius`.
- **The denominator is `TNTS`, not the number of triangles, and the
  paper settles it rather than the Zoo.** Immediately after defining
  `TNTS` the source writes that “the total number of triangle structure
  exists in the network are `1/3 * TNTS`”, so `TNTS = 3 * Delta` and the
  share sums to exactly one over the nodes. Entry 2.221 of the
  Centrality Zoo transcribes the structure of both equations correctly
  but names the denominator “`Delta`, the total number of triangular
  structures in the network”, which read literally is three times too
  small: on the Krackhardt kite that reading scores node 1 at 125.45
  where the paper gives 100.15. cograph follows the paper.
- `lhc_radius` is the source’s own parameter, exposed with the source’s
  default. The paper writes it `d`, states on page 4 that it “is set to
  be 2”, and sweeps it in section 3 over eleven real networks, reporting
  “the optimal value of d is about 2-3”. At `lhc_radius = 1` the ball
  collapses to the neighbours; at or above the graph’s radius the score
  stops moving. The domain is a whole number of at least one and
  anything else raises `cograph_bad_parameter`.
- **Triangle-free graphs are an explicit cograph decision.** Every tree,
  star, path, even cycle and bipartite graph has `TNTS = 0`, making
  `TP(u)` a `0/0` at every node, and the source never mentions the case.
  Since `TNTS` is a sum of nonnegative counts it vanishes exactly when
  every numerator does, so there is no share to distribute: `TP` is
  written as zero and the index reduces to the pure
  degree-over-squared-distance sum. The test is made before any
  division, so no `0/0` is evaluated.
- **Raw scores are not component-local.** `TNTS` is a global sum, so
  attaching a disconnected component that carries a triangle rescales
  every score, while attaching one with no triangle – an isolate
  included – changes nothing. An isolate scores zero because its
  neighbourhood is empty; a singleton and every node of an edgeless
  graph score zero for the same reason.
- Direction, weights, loops and parallel edges are dropped to the simple
  undirected skeleton the source defines on; `mode`, `cutoff` and
  `invert_weights` are ignored, and `normalized = TRUE` max-scales, the
  source stating no normalization.
- **The source prints no numerical example**, so there is no published
  per-node table to reproduce. Acceptance rests on three independent
  reference routes and on hand-derived closed forms for stars, complete
  graphs, rings and paths.

#### Centrality Batch 47 — randomized shortest paths betweenness

- Added
  [`centrality_rsp_betweenness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_rsp_betweenness.md),
  the simple randomized shortest paths betweenness of Kivimaki,
  Lebichot, Saramaki and Saerens. A Boltzmann distribution over the
  absorbing walks from `s` to `t` is tilted by an inverse temperature
  away from the unbiased random walk and towards low-cost walks, and a
  node scores the expected number of visits it receives summed over
  every ordered source-target pair,
  `bet_i = sum_{s,t} (z_si / z_st - z_ti / z_tt) z_it` with
  `Z = (I - W)^-1` and `W = (D^-1 A) o exp(-beta C)`. New parameters
  `rsp_beta` and `rsp_cost`.
- **The published closed form is defined only on a strongly connected
  graph, and the source says what to do otherwise.** Equation (15)
  divides by every entry of `Z`, and Algorithm 1 takes a strongly
  connected graph as its input, but the text below equation (9) settles
  the general case: the derivation “holds only if there exists a path
  from `s` to `t`. Otherwise, naturally, `eta_ij(s, t) = 0`.” cograph
  evaluates the closed form masked by reachability, which reproduces
  equation (15) to machine precision whenever the graph is strongly
  connected and applies the source’s own zero rule when it is not.
- **Scores are therefore component-local.** Two disjoint triangles score
  exactly what one triangle scores, and adding a disconnected component
  – an isolate included – leaves every existing score untouched.
- **A zero out-degree gives a derived zero, not an imputed one.** `D^-1`
  is undefined there, so cograph writes that row of `P^ref` as zero,
  which is the paper’s own killed random walk read at a node where the
  walker dies at once; `Z` then has `z_ii = 1` and the arithmetic gives
  exactly `1 - 1 = 0`. An isolate, a singleton graph and every node of
  an edgeless graph score zero for that reason.
  `NetworkToolbox::rspbc()` raises an error on such input and
  `plot`-side `current_flow_betweenness` returns `NA` on disconnected
  input; this measure can answer where those cannot, because `(I - W)`
  stays nonsingular whatever the connectivity.
- Records a divergence from the CRAN reference implementation:
  `NetworkToolbox::rspbc()` masks only the reciprocal half of the term
  and leaves the `n Diag(Z')` half counting every source, so the two
  agree exactly on strongly connected input and part company on a
  disconnected graph. That function additionally rounds to zero decimals
  and shifts so its minimum is one, post-processing that is nowhere in
  the paper and is not copied here.
- `rsp_beta` defaults to 0.01, which is **not** the source’s number: the
  paper fixes no default and treats it as a modelling choice. 0.01 is
  the value `NetworkToolbox::rspbc()` recommends, adopted so the two are
  comparable out of the box; it sits near the random-walk end, so raise
  it towards 1 and beyond to move the reading towards shortest paths.
  The domain is `rsp_beta > 0` and values outside it raise
  `cograph_bad_parameter`.
- `rsp_cost` chooses how a weight becomes a cost, which the source
  leaves free: `"inverse"` (default) sets `C = 1 / w`, reading a weight
  as an affinity, as the CRAN reference hard-codes; `"weight"` sets
  `C = w`, reading it as a distance. The two coincide on a binary graph.
  Negative and non-finite weights raise `cograph_bad_input`, Algorithm 1
  requiring a non-negative cost matrix.
- Direction is read from the graph rather than from `mode`, so a
  reversed input generally scores differently. Marked **costly**: one
  dense `n x n` inverse, which the source itself calls the computational
  bottleneck at `O(n^3)` time and `O(n^2)` memory.
- The paper prints no table of node scores on a small graph, so there is
  no published per-node example to reproduce. What is checked against
  the paper instead is its printed page 9 limit claim, that the score
  becomes proportional to degree as `beta` approaches zero from above on
  an undirected network; it holds, and does so at first order in `beta`.

#### Centrality Batch 46 — hybrid characteristic centrality (HCC and EHCC)

- Added
  [`centrality_hcc()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_hcc.md)
  and
  [`centrality_ehcc()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ehcc.md),
  the hybrid characteristic centrality of Liu and Zheng and its
  extension. HCC adds two normalised halves: the *extended degree*
  `delta * k + (1 - delta) * sum of the neighbours' degrees` over its
  largest value, and the round in which an *E-shell* peel removes the
  node over the number of rounds. EHCC is the closed-neighbourhood sum
  of HCC, the focal node counted once. New parameter `hcc_delta`,
  default the source’s 0.5.
- **The source’s printed algorithm contains a typo, and cograph
  implements the correction its own tables require.** Step 3 of the
  E-shell procedure prints `S_p = arg max` while the same sentence calls
  `S_p` “the set of minimum nodes” and the paper’s table 2 heads its
  column “Minimum extended degree” with the increasing values 2, 2.5, 3,
  4.5, 5, 6. The minimum reading reproduces every printed row; the
  literal maximum peel deletes a different set first and finishes in
  four rounds instead of six.
- **The peel recomputes but equation (4) does not.** Step 6 updates the
  extended degrees on the residual graph, which is what the printed
  table 2 minima require, while equation (4)’s `k^ex` and `k^ex_max` are
  the original-graph values. The paper’s node `d` settles it: its
  original 9.5 gives the printed 1.86, its residual 6 gives 1.55.
- **Raw scores are not component-local.** `k^ex_max` and `pos_max` are
  single global constants, so a disconnected addition rescales the two
  halves independently rather than by one common factor.
- Records an unresolved disagreement with the source: table 3 prints
  `EHCC(g) = 10.01` for its figure 1, where the exact value `661/66` is
  10.015151… and rounds to 10.02. That printed cell is the truncation,
  but six other printed cells require rounding, so no single convention
  reproduces all twenty table 3 entries. The other 85 printed values
  reproduce.
- Degenerate cases are stated on the help pages: an isolate has extended
  degree zero, the global minimum for every `hcc_delta` in `[0, 1]`, so
  it always leaves in the first round; an edgeless graph makes equation
  (4)’s first term `0/0`, written as zero, so every node of an edgeless
  graph — a singleton included — scores exactly 1. `hcc_delta` outside
  the source’s stated `[0, 1]` raises `cograph_bad_parameter` rather
  than being extended.
- Documents a divergence from the Centrality Zoo: it calls the E-shell
  decomposition “a variant of k-shell decomposition”, which it is not —
  there is no outer level loop and no repeat-until-stable inner loop. On
  a four-node path the k-shell reading puts all four nodes in one shell
  where the E-shell peel takes two rounds.

#### Centrality Batch 45 — KED method

- Added
  [`centrality_ked()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ked.md),
  the KED method of Chen, Xiao, Zeng and Zhang: the degree, weighted by
  one plus the normalised entropy of the neighbours’ degrees, times
  `exp(K / N)` for the neighbour-degree sum `K` and the whole graph’s
  order `N`. Two nodes with the same degree and the same number of
  second neighbours are separated by how evenly their neighbours carry
  the onward paths. It takes no parameters: equation (6) is a bare
  product.
- **The logarithm base is not a convention to choose.** Equation (2)
  divides the neighbour-degree entropy by the entropy of the uniform
  distribution on `k` outcomes, so the base cancels top and bottom. A
  full base-ten reading gives identical scores, which is asserted to 60
  digits on every verification fixture.
- **Raw scores depend on the whole graph’s order, and can reorder.** `N`
  is the vertex count of the whole network, and `exp(K / N)` shrinks a
  large neighbour-degree sum more than a small one, so adding a
  disconnected component is not a rescaling: on a seven-node example in
  the tests, one extra isolate swaps two nodes’ places.
- Records that the source’s stated range `1 <= D <= e` is not general.
  It needs `K <= N`, which holds on the sparse toy networks of its
  figure 1 and on only 1,598 of the 5,532 verification fixtures; every
  node of the five-clique has `K = 16` against `N = 5`. cograph
  implements the formula, not the range claim, and raises an error
  rather than returning `Inf` if the exponent ever leaves the range of
  [`exp()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html).
- Documents a divergence from the Centrality Zoo: its section 2.215
  drops the `1 +` from `E`, divides `K` by the largest cluster degree
  instead of by `N`, and adds tunable exponents that appear nowhere in
  the paper. On the source’s own figure 1 that reading gives 13.5914 and
  6.5672 where the paper prints 25.9187 and 19.2212. cograph implements
  the paper and offers no Zoo variant.
- Two cases the source never mentions are cograph decisions, stated on
  the help page: a node with one neighbour has `0/0` for its normalised
  entropy and takes zero, and an isolate scores zero.

#### Centrality Batch 44 — Local neighbor contribution (LNC)

- Added
  [`centrality_lnc()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_lnc.md),
  the local neighbor contribution of Dai, Wang, Sheng, Sun, Khawaja,
  Ullah, Dejene and Duan: the chance that a node picking a neighbour at
  random picks a given one and misses the rest, scaled by its degree,
  multiplied by the sum of its neighbours’ degrees weighted by their
  degree centralities. It takes no parameters, which the source
  advertises as one of its contributions.
- **Raw scores depend on the whole graph’s order.** The `1 / (n - 1)`
  comes from the source’s degree centrality, where `n` counts every node
  in the network rather than in the component, so adding a disconnected
  component multiplies every score by `(n - 1) / (n' - 1)`. The ranking
  is untouched; the raw values are not.
- Implements the source’s printed numbers, not its printed equations,
  and says so. Equations (4) and (5) sum over `j = 1` to `k`, and `k` is
  described three incompatible ways: the prose calls it the number of
  nearest and next nearest neighbours, Algorithm 1 sets it to the
  degree, and equation (5) read literally carries one factor of the
  degree too many and returns 6.75 where the paper prints 1.6875.
  Inverting each of the eleven printed influences gives `k = d^2` in (4)
  and `k = d` in (5), the reading implemented here; the alternative
  literal split of the two factors gives the same product, so the
  measure itself is unambiguous.
- Documents a divergence from the Centrality Zoo: its section 2.238
  replaces the focal node’s contribution probability with each
  neighbour’s and the binomial count with the size of the two-hop
  neighbourhood. That formula reproduces none of the eleven printed
  values and inverts the paper’s headline ranking, so no Zoo variant is
  offered.
- Isolates and the single node of a singleton graph score zero as an
  explicit cograph extension: the source has no value where the degree,
  and hence `1 / d`, is undefined, and no result is silently `NaN`.

#### Centrality Batch 43 — Iterative resource allocation (IRA and IIRA)

- Added
  [`centrality_ira()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ira.md),
  the iterative resource allocation of Ren, Zeng, Chen, Liao and Liu:
  every node starts with one unit of resource and hands it repeatedly to
  its neighbours in proportion to the receiver’s centrality until the
  amounts stop moving. `ira_mass`, `ira_alpha`, `ira_tol` and
  `ira_max_iter` expose the source’s `theta`, `alpha`, `epsilon` and
  iteration bound. Every non-empty column of the allocation matrix sums
  to one, so a component’s scores sum to its vertex count.
- Added
  [`centrality_iira()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_iira.md),
  the improved variant of Zhong, Liu and Shang, which scales each share
  by `1 - (1 - beta)^k`. That factor is strictly below one, so the
  resource decays geometrically; the source fixes the step count instead
  of a tolerance. `iira_beta` and `iira_steps` default to the source’s
  0.2 and 50, the raw `I(50)` is returned so the printed example is
  reproducible, and `normalized = TRUE` max-scales it. Raw IIRA scores
  from different connected components are on different exponential
  scales and must not be compared.
- **`ira` reports non-convergence instead of hiding it.** The allocation
  matrix is a reversible walk, so on a bipartite component it has an
  eigenvalue of exactly -1 whose coefficient in the all-ones start is
  the difference between the two class sizes. When those differ, the
  resource settles into a period-two cycle and no tolerance is ever met:
  the three-star alternates for ever between `3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3` and
  `1, 1, 1, 1`.
  [`centrality_ira()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ira.md)
  then stops at `ira_max_iter`, raises a classed `cograph_no_converge`
  warning naming the largest remaining change, and returns that
  parity-dependent iterate. Neither source mentions this case.
- Documents two divergences from the Centrality Zoo: its IRA entry
  states the transpose and asks for an eigenvector, which sidesteps
  rather than reports the bipartite case, and its IIRA formula pairs the
  numerator index with the wrong neighbourhood, giving a matrix that is
  stochastic in neither direction and reproduces neither printed
  quantity. cograph implements the papers.
- Records that one printed table entry is reproduced only from the exact
  steady state: the source rounds `15/8` up to `1.88`, while the
  iteration approaches that limit from below and returns `1.8749998`,
  which rounds to `1.87`. No author software exists for either measure.

#### Centrality Batch 42 — Neighborhood (neighbor distance) centrality

- Added
  [`centrality_neighbor_distance()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_neighbor_distance.md),
  the neighborhood centrality of Liu, Tang, Zhou and Do: a benchmark
  centrality plus its decayed sums over the non-backtracking walks that
  leave the node. `nd_order`, `nd_decay` and `nd_mass` expose the
  source’s `n`, `a` and `theta`, and the defaults (degree, two steps,
  0.2) are the setting the Centrality Zoo calls neighbor distance
  centrality.
- Implements the source’s nested sums, in which each level excludes only
  the node the walk just came from, so an endpoint reached by several
  walks is counted once per walk. This is **not** a sum over distance
  shells. The Zoo’s paraphrase writes k-hop neighbour sets instead; the
  two agree on trees and differ on any graph with a triangle or a short
  cycle, and the difference is documented rather than offered as a
  variant.
- Documents that the source prints no table of node scores, so there is
  no published numerical fixture, and that no author software exists.

#### Centrality Batch 41 — Relative-entropy integrated evaluation

- Added
  [`centrality_relative_entropy()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_relative_entropy.md),
  which turns several indexes into discrete distributions and returns
  the unit-sum distribution with the smallest total relative entropy to
  all of them: the normalised geometric mean of the index distributions.
- `re_indexes` chooses the constituents from six the source both defines
  and gives an evaluating direction (degree, closeness, betweenness,
  constraint, and the two post-deletion destructiveness indexes
  `n_components` and `largest_component`); `re_negative` overrides which
  of them are read as “smaller is more important”. The default
  reproduces the published Kite study’s four-index column, and all three
  of its printed integrated columns are reproduced.
- Documents the two non-standard conventions the source uses – its
  constraint sums over every node rather than over the neighbours, so it
  is not Burt’s constraint, and its betweenness counts ordered pairs –
  along with the reachable-partner closeness extension used outside its
  connected domain. An index that is zero at every node leaves the
  definition without a value and raises a classed
  `cograph_undefined_index` error rather than returning zeros.
- [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  no longer lets one undefined measure end a whole tier. A measure named
  in `measures` or `include` still raises, but when `type = "basic"`,
  `"extended"` or `"all"` supplied it, an undefined result becomes a
  `cograph_undefined_measure` warning and an `NA` column, matching what
  the community-partition measures already do without `membership`.

#### Centrality Batch 40 — DK-based gravity model

- Added
  [`centrality_dkgm()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_dkgm.md),
  whose mass is the degree k-shell index: the original degree plus a
  shell number refined by the stage at which the node left that shell
  during the k-shell peeling.
- Default `dkgm_radius = 2` matches the paper’s printed nine-node
  example, which the implementation reproduces along with its removal
  stages, improved shell indices and DK values. `"auto"` applies the
  paper’s own half-mean-distance rule with cograph rounding.
- Documents the published pseudocode/prose disagreement over removing
  nodes of degree exactly `k` versus at most `k`, the one-shell
  placement of isolates, and the single global stage denominator, which
  makes raw scores depend on disconnected components.

#### Centrality Batch 39 — Mixed gravitational centralities

- Added
  [`centrality_mixed_gravity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_mixed_gravity.md)
  and
  [`centrality_extended_mixed_gravity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_extended_mixed_gravity.md),
  using focal core numbers and partner degrees, with an optional outer
  sum over immediate neighbors.
- Default radius three follows the explicit published reproduction;
  radius one exposes the Zoo summary’s literal interpretation. Both
  functions document source provenance, skeleton projections and
  normalization.

#### Centrality Batch 38 — Multi-characteristics gravity model

- Added
  [`centrality_mcgm()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_mcgm.md)
  with the published adaptive coefficient and default radius two, plus
  explicit radius and coefficient overrides.
- Reproduces the nine-node published example. Uses a simple undirected
  skeleton and documents the eigenvector convention for disconnected
  graphs. Undefined automatic coefficients require an explicit override.

#### Centrality Batch 37 — SpectralRank

- Added
  [`centrality_spectralrank()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_spectralrank.md)
  with optional scalar or node-specific diagonal priors. Scores use
  outgoing neighbors in an augmented graph.
- Preserves the paper’s normalization over original and ground nodes;
  optional package normalization rescales original nodes alone. Uses the
  Perron eigenvector also on edgeless graphs where plain iteration
  oscillates.

#### Centrality Batch 36 — ControlRank

- Added
  [`centrality_controlrank()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_controlrank.md),
  the smallest eigenvalue of each grounded symmetric row-Laplacian,
  retaining original degrees after node deletion.
- Supports nonnegative weighted graphs, an explicit outgoing orientation
  for directed inputs, and signed directed scores. Reproduces the
  published bi-star example and is marked costly because it solves one
  spectrum per node.

#### Centrality Batch 35 — Map equation centrality

- Added
  [`centrality_map_equation()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_map_equation.md)
  for fixed one-level or leaf-module partitions, with recorded node and
  unrecorded link teleportation.
- Coding conventions are explicit: `paper` includes module-exit flow as
  defined in the equations; `infomap` reproduces the author’s visit-only
  implementation and published table. Both conventions have independent
  numerical verification. Stable arithmetic retains extremely small
  scores.
- Invalid missing, nonfinite, nonscalar or nonnumeric damping inputs now
  receive the centrality argument error instead of an incidental R
  error.

#### Centrality Batch 34 — Node and Neighbor Layer Information

- Added
  [`centrality_ninl()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ninl.md)
  with the full finite iteration family (default three) and optional
  radius overrides. The initial score sums degrees within the ceiling of
  average path length, then propagates through neighbors.
- Reproduces all 52 entries in Zhu and Wang’s published example. Uses
  simple undirected unweighted topology, with explicit
  disconnected-graph and normalization conventions. Preserves bipartite
  alternation at large orders.

#### Centrality Batch 33 — Localized bridging and Extended LBC

- Added
  [`centrality_localized_bridging()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_localized_bridging.md)
  and
  [`centrality_extended_local_bridging()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_extended_local_bridging.md):
  one-hop and two-hop ego betweenness multiplied by the original-graph
  bridging coefficient. Uses simple, undirected, unweighted topology;
  the two-hop variant is marked costly.
- Corrected the Zoo localized-bridging mapping. `local_bridging` retains
  its existing inverse-degree product, which is a different score.

#### Centrality Batch 32 — BG-index and beta power

- Added
  [`centrality_beta_measure()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_beta_measure.md)
  with positive and negative directed variants. Successors share one
  unit equally among their predecessors; the negative variant reverses
  the graph. Loops and duplicate arcs are removed, weights ignored, and
  isolates score zero.
- Covers both Zoo labels BG-index and beta-measure. Independent
  predecessor choice enumeration and the original published diamond
  example verify numerical scores, with direction and normalization
  checked through the API.

#### Centrality Batch 31 — Expected Force and its degree adjustment

- Added
  [`centrality_expected_force()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_expected_force.md)
  and
  [`centrality_modified_expected_force()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_modified_expected_force.md)
  from Lawyer’s two-event definition, with explicit sequence
  multiplicity, boundary-edge counting, direction and exhausted-force
  conventions.
- Corrected the Zoo Expected Force mapping: `expected` computes
  neighbor-degree sums and remains available under that definition. ExF
  now maps to `expected_force`; the original ExFm candidate maps to the
  modified function.
- Verified against independent event enumeration and pinned author C++
  on its connected undirected domain. No author code is included in the
  package.

#### Centrality Batch 30 — Proximal betweenness

- Added
  [`centrality_proximal_betweenness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_proximal_betweenness.md)
  with source, target, sum and union variants from Brandes. Uses
  directed unweighted shortest paths, excludes endpoints, and explicitly
  preserves ordered-pair raw scaling.
- Independent path enumeration and exact integer adjacency powers verify
  both orientations and overlap counting. Nonfinite path counts raise
  errors.

#### Centrality Batch 29 — Bridging capital

- Added
  [`centrality_bridging_capital()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_bridging_capital.md)
  with a finite walk horizon and optional source-destination information
  values. It follows Jackson’s single-entry deletion definition using
  transmission probabilities between zero and one.
- Independent matrix-power and walk-enumeration checks verify
  repeated-edge counting, direction, loops and valued information.
  Native tracking avoids cancellation; this dense, costly measure must
  be requested explicitly.

#### Centrality Batch 28 — Coleman-Theil hierarchy

- Added
  [`centrality_coleman_theil()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_coleman_theil.md),
  measuring concentration of Burt’s dyadic constraints using mutual tie
  weights. Follows the author’s explicit isolate-zero and
  single-contact-one conventions, with organizational multipliers fixed
  at one.
- Verified against NetworkX local constraints, exact rational
  calculations and high-precision entropy checks. Stable arithmetic
  preserves small departures from uniformity; weights, direction and
  parallel ties have documented handling.

#### Centrality Batch 27 — X-degree

- Added
  [`centrality_x_degree()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_x_degree.md),
  counting four-edge nonbacktracking walks centered at each node using
  original neighbor excess degrees. It uses the simple undirected
  unweighted skeleton and supports maximum normalization.
- Verified against pinned author code, independent nonbacktracking
  matrix blocks and explicit walk enumeration, including all simple
  labeled graphs through five vertices. This adds a static score; it
  does not perform the paper’s iterative immunization strategy.

#### Centrality Batch 26 — LineRank

- Added
  [`centrality_linerank()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_linerank.md),
  using directed line-graph walks or the ordinary undirected line graph
  clarified by Kosa et al. (2015).
- Exposes probability aggregation and the original pseudocode’s
  additional edge-weight aggregation as explicit `linerank_aggregation`
  choices. Supports loops and remaining parallel edge states with
  documented conventions, uniform dangling redistribution and damping in
  \[0,1).
- Uses a native dense stationary solve and is marked costly.
  Verification compares NetworkX line graphs/PageRank and Markov-chain
  tree cofactors. The original pseudocode’s inconsistent normalization
  is not replicated.

#### Centrality Batch 25 — random walk decay

- Added
  [`centrality_random_walk_decay()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_random_walk_decay.md)
  with `rwd_decay` and optional `rwd_node_weights`. Scores sum
  discounted first-arrival probabilities, including the starting node.
  Retains directed flow, weighted transitions and loops; sinks terminate
  the walk without restarting it elsewhere.
- Supports personalized starting mass, zero decay as a limit,
  disconnected graphs and normalized scores when raw sums overflow.
  Per-target absorbing solves make the measure costly; request it
  explicitly.
- Independently verified using full-resolvent ratios, explicit
  first-visit series, exact rational arithmetic and high-precision
  calculations. Reproduces the published Example 4 and 5 tables; the
  inconsistent Example 3 values are retained as a source discrepancy.

#### Centrality Batch 24 — graph regularization centrality

- Added
  [`centrality_graph_regularization()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_graph_regularization.md)
  with finite nonnegative `grc_gamma`, default one. Computes reciprocal
  diagonal entries of the inverse regularized weighted Laplacian.
  Isolates and zero regularization score one; disconnected components
  are independent before normalization.
- A component spectral calculation supports extreme regularization and
  uniform weight scales without overflowing their product. Unresolvable
  weight ranges or positive spectra raise explicit numerical errors.
- Verified against SciPy direct solves, determinant ratios,
  high-precision arithmetic and convergence of the retained author
  implementation. The author’s default ten-term approximation is audited
  separately and is not claimed to give identical values.

#### Centrality Batch 23 — adaptive LeaderRank

- Added
  [`centrality_adaptive_leaderrank()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_adaptive_leaderrank.md),
  weighting every destination by its original open-neighborhood H-index
  and adding a ground node with H-index one. Retains source total mass N
  and omits the ground score without redistribution. Zero H-indices
  receive zero stationary scores; an all-zero H-index vector yields NaN.
- `alr_h_mode` selects the H-index convention: all (default), out or in.
  The paper leaves its directed H-index choice unspecified; these
  choices are explicit cograph conventions, while resource flow retains
  input arcs. The focal node is excluded from the H-index calculation.
- Verified against independent NetworkX iteration, Markov-chain tree
  cofactors and a reversible-conductance identity for undirected inputs.

#### Centrality Batch 22 — weighted LeaderRank

- Added
  [`centrality_weighted_leaderrank()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_weighted_leaderrank.md)
  with finite `wlr_alpha`, default one. Original directed arcs retain
  unit weight and ground-to-node weights depend on original in-degree.
  Input edge weights are ignored. Undirected edges are represented as
  opposite arcs.
- Uses the original paper’s N+1 initial mass and omits the ground score
  without redistribution. Zoo’s N-mass initialization differs by a
  constant factor; max-normalized scores agree. Negative exponents
  require positive in-degrees; positive exponents on edgeless graphs
  return NaN.
- A native stationary solve handles periodic chains and shifted
  logarithms avoid overflow in degree powers. Verification uses NetworkX
  lazy-chain iteration, Markov-chain tree cofactors and 100-digit stress
  references.

#### Centrality Batch 21 — global structure models

- Added
  [`centrality_global_structure()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_global_structure.md)
  (GSM),
  [`centrality_hybrid_global_structure()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_hybrid_global_structure.md)
  (H-GSM) and
  [`centrality_improved_global_structure()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_improved_global_structure.md)
  (IGSM). GSM uses coreness; H-GSM combines degree and coreness; IGSM
  uses degree. The latter two use their published adaptive distance
  exponents. All three use the simple undirected skeleton, with explicit
  zero contributions for unreachable partners and global size/means that
  include isolates.
- IGSM follows the equation reproduced in Mukhtar et al. (2023); the
  original Zhu and Wang (2022) full text was unavailable. Its zero or
  negative distance exponents on sparse disconnected graphs are
  retained.
- Verified against independent NetworkX calculations, exhaustive
  small-graph core enumeration, and published focal calculations. H-GSM
  uses logarithmic sums so normalized results remain available when raw
  scores or self-influence exceed double precision; 100-digit reference
  stress checks cover both overflow and very small normalized values.

#### Centrality Batch 20 — exogenous centrality

- Added
  [`centrality_exogenous()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_exogenous.md)
  with degree, betweenness and adjusted reverse-closeness bases.
  Measures the contribution to other nodes’ centrality when the focal
  node is deleted. Supports directed base directions and retains
  negative betweenness contributions.
- Reverse-closeness retains the original graph size after deletion. All
  bases use simple binary topology and raw scores before any optional
  final normalization. Repeated graph deletion places this measure in
  the costly tier. Verification includes independent NetworkX scores,
  explicit path enumeration and a documented audit of discrepancies in
  the original paper’s Florentine table.

#### Centrality Batch 19 — improved closeness

- Added
  [`centrality_improved_closeness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_improved_closeness.md)
  with `icc_alpha` in \[0,1\], default 0.2, following Luan et al.’s
  shortest-path multiplicity formula. Uses the simple undirected
  skeleton; alpha zero recovers ordinary normalized closeness on
  connected graphs. Disconnected graphs and singletons score zero under
  explicit cograph conventions.
- Verified against exact integer adjacency powers, NetworkX
  shortest-path enumeration and igraph’s closeness limit. Logarithmic
  path counting avoids overflow on graphs with more shortest paths than
  doubles can hold.

#### Centrality Batch 18 — weighted clustering degree algorithm

- Added
  [`centrality_cda()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_cda.md)
  with `cda_alpha`, default 0.5. Returns Wang et al.’s
  propagation-capability score using degree, strength, Barrat clustering
  and weighted neighbor contributions. The full weighted calculation
  retains original weight units and a global maximum weight.
- Verified against igraph Barrat clustering and independent Python
  neighbor-pair enumeration across mixing parameters, including endpoint
  scaling, disconnected inputs, labels and input projections.

#### Centrality Batch 17 — extended coreness and gravity

- Added
  [`centrality_extended_coreness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_extended_coreness.md),
  the two-step aggregation of original core numbers, and
  [`centrality_extended_gravity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_extended_gravity.md),
  the sum of immediate neighbors’ raw k-shell gravity scores. Both use
  the simple undirected skeleton and assign isolates zero.
- Extended gravity supports `gravity_radius`, default three as in Ma et
  al. The radius applies around each neighbor before the outer sum.
  Independent checks use NetworkX cores and distances and an exhaustive
  core-number oracle on small graphs, covering multiple radii and input
  projections.

#### Centrality Batch 16 — node resistance curvature

- Added
  [`centrality_resistance_curvature()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_resistance_curvature.md),
  implementing Devriendt and Lambiotte’s conductance-weighted node
  curvature component by component. Raw scores can be negative; isolates
  score one. Directed projection, zero conductances, normalization and
  numerical limits are documented.
- Independent checks use NetworkX effective resistance and exhaustive
  weighted spanning-tree degree expectations on small graphs. Dense
  electrical solves make this an explicitly requested costly measure.

#### Centrality Batch 15 — dynamics-sensitive and Malatya centrality

- Added
  [`centrality_dynamics_sensitive()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_dynamics_sensitive.md)
  with `ds_beta`, `ds_mu` and `ds_steps`, including the full
  recovery-rate family from Liu et al. Recovery rate one recovers the
  finite-diffusion formula listed by Zoo; recovery zero supports the
  paper’s SI case. These are linearized scores, with their
  interpretation and numerical limits documented explicitly.
- Added
  [`centrality_malatya()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_malatya.md),
  the static degree-ratio sum. On nonisolated nodes it is exactly the
  reciprocal of the bridging coefficient. Both additions use the simple
  undirected skeleton and assign isolates zero.
- Verification uses independently expanded matrix/walk formulas and
  NetworkX neighbour-degree arithmetic, with documented parameter
  limits.

#### Centrality Batch 14 — finite diffusion and dynamical importance

- Added
  [`centrality_diffusion_centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_diffusion_centrality.md)
  with `diffusion_q` and `diffusion_steps`. It evaluates Banerjee et
  al.’s finite weighted walk sum, separate from existing diffusion
  degree and the TNA power series. Directed edges follow their outgoing
  orientation; weights, loops and repeated walks are supported.
  Probability interpretation and default parameter choices are
  documented explicitly.
- Added
  [`centrality_dynamical_importance()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_dynamical_importance.md):
  relative spectral-radius loss on node deletion, recomputed directly.
  It supports nonnegative directed weighted graphs, removes loops and
  returns NaN when the original radius is zero. This costly measure is
  held back from the default all tier.
- Independent numerical checks use explicit walk enumeration, NumPy
  matrix powers and eigenspectra, and SymPy exact characteristic
  polynomials.
- Fixed the existing TNA power-series method’s missing binary fallback
  for unweighted igraph inputs. Normalization now preserves entirely
  undefined or empty result vectors without an empty-maximum warning.

#### Centrality Batch 13 — volume and maximal cliques

- Added
  [`centrality_volume()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_volume.md)
  with `volume_radius` and
  [`centrality_mcc()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_mcc.md),
  also available through `centrality(measures = )`. Both use the simple
  undirected skeleton. Volume sums original degrees over closed hop
  neighbourhoods; MCC sums factorial contributions from maximal cliques.
- MCC explicitly excludes singleton cliques (isolates score zero),
  reports numerical overflow, and is held back from the default
  `type = "all"` tier because clique enumeration has exponential
  worst-case cost.
- Verification uses NetworkX neighbourhoods and maximal cliques, plus
  exhaustive recognition of maximal cliques on graphs of up to ten
  nodes.
- Corrected the catalogue’s existing diffusion entry: default diffusion
  degree and the TNA power series are separate formulas. The Banerjee
  diffusion-centrality candidate remains pending.

#### Centrality Batch 12 — verified parameter candidates

- Added
  [`centrality_truss()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_truss.md),
  [`centrality_mdd()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_truss.md),
  [`centrality_bridging_coefficient()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_truss.md),
  [`centrality_godfather()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_truss.md)
  and
  [`centrality_support()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_truss.md),
  also available through `centrality(measures = )`. They use the simple
  undirected skeleton. `mdd_lambda` controls the exhausted-degree
  weight; truss numbers use the k-2 triangle convention.
- Documented LocalRank as the existing `semilocal` measure on simple
  undirected graphs. Corrected parameterized Zoo lookup calls and
  replaced unsupported equivalence claims based solely on rank
  correlation.
- Numerical checks cover NetworkX, centiserve and independent
  combinatorial references. The original 160 candidate rows remain
  tracked in `docs/zoo/parameter_candidate_status.csv`.

#### Centrality Batch 7 — Centrality Zoo comparison batch

Five measures chosen from the Centrality Zoo correlation study (Shvydun
2025; 349 measures, 648 ICON networks, average Kendall tau) as the ones
with the **lowest rank redundancy** against what
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
already computed (maximum tau with any existing measure in parentheses).
All are implemented in base R on matrices (`R/kernels-batch7.R`) with
thin igraph glue and one exported verb each (`R/centrality-batch7.R`).

- [`centrality_distance_entropy()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_distance_entropy.md)
  (tau 0.30) — Stella & De Domenico (2018). Normalised Shannon entropy
  of a node’s hop-distance profile; closeness is the mean of that
  profile, this is its spread. The normaliser is `log(M - m + 1)` so a
  uniform profile scores exactly 1 (the printed formula’s `log(M - m)`
  is undefined for two distances).
- [`centrality_local_dimension()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_dimension.md)
  (tau 0.50) — Pu et al. (2014). OLS slope of `ln B(r)` on `ln r`, ball
  including the centre. Reproduces the worked example of Wen &
  Deng (2019) exactly (0.9231). Lower = more influential.
- [`centrality_local_information_dimension()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_information_dimension.md)
  (tau 0.38) — Wen & Deng (2020). Entropy-weighted local dimension over
  boxes up to half the eccentricity. Higher = more influential.
  Single-box nodes use the paper’s discretised derivative.
- [`centrality_modularity_vitality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_modularity_vitality.md)
  (tau 0.40) — Magelinski, Bartulovic & Carley (2021).
  `Q(G, C) - Q(G - i, C \ i)` under a fixed partition; positive =
  community hub, negative = bridge. Closed-form vectorised update (one
  matrix product for all nodes); matches brute-force
  [`igraph::modularity()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/modularity.igraph.html)
  after deletion on random directed, undirected and weighted graphs.
  Requires `membership`; wrong-length input raises
  `cograph_bad_membership`.
- [`centrality_neighborhood_connectivity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_neighborhood_connectivity.md)
  (tau 0.64) — Maslov & Sneppen (2002). Mean neighbour degree, isolates
  0; equals `igraph::knn(weights = NA)`, with `mode` support.

The three distance-scaling measures are hop-count measures and ignore
edge weights (as `gravity` and `collective_influence` already do); they
share one unweighted all-pairs matrix per
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
call.

#### Centrality Batch 8 — the Zoo’s “on the way” measures

The twelve measures the batch 7 lookup listed as “on the way” are now
implemented (thirteen
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
measures), each verified against an exact brute-force definition or the
source paper’s own numbers, plus an independent Python reference written
from the paper (kept in `local_testing_and_equivalence/batch8/`, not
shipped). Base-R kernels in `R/kernels-batch8.R`, verbs in
`R/centrality-batch8.R`.

- [`centrality_shapley_game1()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_shapley_game1.md),
  `_game2()`, `_game3()` — Michalak et al.
  2013. closed-form Shapley values of the one-hop, `shapley_k`-neighbour
        and `shapley_cutoff`-hop coverage games. Equal to exact Shapley
        values from full coalition enumeration on random graphs of up to
        8 nodes (with isolates, loops, several components), directed
        extension included.
- [`centrality_access_information()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_access_information.md),
  [`centrality_hide_information()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_access_information.md)
  — Rosvall et al. (2005) / Sneppen et al. (2005) search information,
  averaged from and to each node; shortest-path DAG accumulation, no
  path enumeration. Equal to explicit all-shortest-paths enumeration;
  reproduces the papers’ star and complete-bipartite values.
  Disconnected graphs average over each node’s reachable set.
- [`centrality_rumor()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_rumor.md)
  — Shah & Zaman (2011) rumor centrality on each node’s BFS tree, log
  scale. [`exp()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html) of it equals
  brute-force spreading-order counts on trees; reproduces the paper’s
  Fig. 5 (8, 12, 2, 3, 3).
- [`centrality_community_hub_bridge()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_community_hub_bridge.md)
  — Ghalmane, El Hassouni & Cherifi
  2019. raw hub-bridge score (needs `membership`;
        `cograph_bad_membership` on bad input).
- `centrality_entropy_variation(of = "degree" | "betweenness")` —
  Ai (2017) signed entropy drop on node deletion; degree variant in
  closed form. Equal to the author’s own R code path to 1e-15 and to the
  paper’s Table 2 quantiles on its 4234-node network.
- [`centrality_s_shell()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_s_shell.md)
  — Liu, Tang, Do & Hui (2017) strength-based shell index with
  asymmetric topological weights (`s_shell_a`, default 0.5). The Zoo’s
  “s-shell index” is this measure, not the Eidsaa-Almaas s-core. Shells
  verified against the maximal-subgraph definition; `a = 0` gives k-core
  dense ranks.
- [`centrality_degree_discount()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_degree_discount.md),
  [`centrality_single_discount()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_degree_discount.md)
  — Chen, Wang & Yang (2009) greedy seed-selection orders
  (`discount_p`), scored like `voterank` (first selected = 1).
- [`centrality_ncvoterank()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ncvoterank.md)
  — Kumar & Panda (2020) neighbourhood-coreness VoteRank
  (`ncvote_theta`). The original article could not be obtained; the
  definition follows the Zoo encyclopedia and three restatements, and
  the coreness normalisation (by its maximum) is a documented choice.
  Its VoteRank limit reproduces `networkx.voterank`.

The Centrality Zoo lookup article and coverage document were
regenerated: 82 Zoo measures are now available in cograph and nothing is
“on the way”.

#### `centrality()` tiers, and a catalogue of the measures

- **`type = "all"` no longer runs the measures whose cost grows steeply
  with network size.** Four are held back: `infection`, `two_way_rw`,
  `node_contraction_improved` and `entropy_variation_betweenness`. On an
  81-node graph `infection` alone took 611 seconds while every other
  measure together took about five, so a single `type = "all"` call
  could take minutes by accident. `type = "basic"` (the default) and
  `type = "extended"` are unchanged.
- **New `include` argument** puts them back: `include = "costly"` for
  all four, or name the ones you want. Naming a measure in `measures =`
  always computes it whatever its cost, so nothing became unreachable.
- **[`list_centralities()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/list_centralities.md)**
  (new export) is a tidy table of every measure with the facts you need
  before reading a column: `orientation` (which end of the scale marks a
  prominent node), `mode_aware`, `needs_membership`, `uses_weights` and
  `costly`. Twelve measures are oriented so that a *low* value marks the
  more central node, including `eccentricity`, `constraint`, `heatmap`
  and the local-dimension family; sorting their column the usual way
  puts the periphery on top. `list_centralities(orientation = "lower")`
  lists them. The measure lists now live in one place that both
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  and
  [`list_centralities()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/list_centralities.md)
  read, and a test asserts the two agree.

### Bug fixes

- `katz` now warns with a `cograph_katz_diverged` condition when
  `katz_alpha` is too large for the graph. Katz converges only for
  `alpha < 1 / rho(A)`; above it the linear solve still returns numbers,
  but they are not Katz scores and can be negative. The default 0.1 is
  invalid on any graph whose spectral radius exceeds 10, which includes
  many weighted networks. The check costs nothing on the happy path and
  the warning names the valid bound.
- `alpha` and `power` now raise a classed `cograph_singular_system`
  error instead of surfacing a bare LU factorization message from igraph
  when `I - alpha A` is singular.
- [`?centrality_dmnc`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_dmnc.md)
  gains a “Divergence from centiserve” section.
  [`centiserve::dmnc()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/dmnc.html)
  counts the largest component’s edges in the wrong index space: its
  membership vector indexes the neighbourhood subgraph but is used to
  subset the original graph. The two disagree on 14 of the 34 karate
  nodes even at a matched epsilon, and reproducing that indexing exactly
  reproduces centiserve’s output. cograph counts the edges of the
  component it actually found. The catalogue’s equivalence claim was
  corrected.

#### Centrality Batch 9 — the remaining Zoo measures with a pinned definition

Twenty more measures (`R/kernels-batch9.R`, `R/centrality-batch9.R`),
each researched from its source paper by a dedicated agent and verified
against published tables, brute-force definitions and an independent
Python reference (kept in `local_testing_and_equivalence/batch9/`, not
shipped).

- Community-aware (need `membership`):
  [`centrality_community_based()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_community_based.md)
  (Zhao et al. 2015; reproduces the paper’s Table 1 and Tulu et al.’s
  Table 1),
  [`centrality_comm_centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_community_based.md)
  (Gupta, Singh & Cherifi 2016; `comm_r`),
  [`centrality_community_mediator()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_community_based.md)
  (Tulu, Hou & Younas 2018; base-2 entropy reproduces its Table 1).
- Dimension family:
  [`centrality_local_dimension_fixed()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_dimension_fixed.md)
  (Silva & Costa 2013; `ld_radius`),
  [`centrality_fuzzy_local_dimension()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_dimension_fixed.md)
  (Wen & Jiang 2019; reproduces its kite Table 1 and karate top ten in
  order),
  [`centrality_local_volume_dimension()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_dimension_fixed.md)
  (Li & Deng 2021; definition from the authors’ later preprint,
  flagged).
- VoteRank family:
  [`centrality_wvoterank()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_wvoterank.md)
  (Sun et al. 2019; reproduces all sixty numbers of its Figure 1),
  [`centrality_enrenew()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_wvoterank.md)
  (Guo et al. 2020; reproduces its Figure 1; `enrenew_depth`),
  [`centrality_voterank_plus()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_wvoterank.md)
  (Liu et al. 2021; matches the authors’ code; `voterank_lambda`).
- [`centrality_node_contraction()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_node_contraction.md)
  and
  [`centrality_node_contraction_improved()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_node_contraction.md)
  (Tan, Wu & Deng 2006; Wang et al. 2011; reproduce Table 1 and the path
  closed forms; `contraction_rho`). The Zoo entry’s “removal” wording is
  wrong; the sources contract.
- [`centrality_two_way_rw()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_two_way_rw.md)
  (Curado et al. 2022; reproduces the paper’s toy example including
  every fraction; O(n^4)).
- Local measures:
  [`centrality_heatmap()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_heatmap.md)
  (Duron 2020; reproduces Table 1; lower = more central),
  [`centrality_flow_coefficient()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_heatmap.md)
  (Honey et al. 2007, BCT form; equals one minus clustering on
  undirected graphs),
  [`centrality_local_entropy()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_heatmap.md)
  (Nie et al. 2016),
  [`centrality_weighted_h_index()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_heatmap.md)
  (Gao et al. 2019),
  [`centrality_redundancy()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_heatmap.md)
  (Burt 1992; Borgatti’s worked example).
- [`centrality_weighted_kshell()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_weighted_kshell.md)
  (Garas, Schweitzer & Havlin 2012; `wks_alpha`, `wks_beta`; Figure 1
  example and Table 2 core size),
  [`centrality_renewed_coreness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_weighted_kshell.md)
  (Liu, Tang, Zhou & Do 2015; Figure 1 and all twelve percentages of its
  Table S1; the Zoo’s transcription is off by one),
  [`centrality_geodesic_kpath()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_weighted_kshell.md)
  (Borgatti & Everett 2006; paths counted with multiplicity;
  [`centiserve::geokpath`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/geokpath.html)
  counts nodes instead).

Not shipped, with reasons recorded in the coverage document:
DegreePunishment, improved WVoteRank and local degree dimension (source
articles unobtainable, definitions rest on the Zoo alone) and
multi-local dimension (a rescaling of local dimension for every q
outside (0, 1)).

New pkgdown article **Centrality Zoo lookup** answers “is the Zoo
measure I want in cograph?”: every Zoo measure listed once under
Available, Almost identical (tau \>= 0.99, with the cograph measure to
use), Near-duplicate (0.90 \<= tau \< 0.99), On the way, or Not
available. `docs/CENTRALITY-ZOO-COVERAGE.md` records the full
intersection of the Zoo matrix with cograph: which Zoo measures are
rank-identical to an existing cograph measure (and therefore not worth
adding), which are near-duplicates, and the remaining ranked candidates.

#### Centrality Batch 10 — the gaps against the other centrality packages

`docs/CENTRALITY-CROSS-COVERAGE.md` counted, in both directions, what
each R and Python centrality package reaches of the Zoo. The five node
measures that other packages offered and
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
did not are now implemented (`R/kernels-batch10.R`,
`R/centrality-batch10.R`), each verified against the package whose gap
it closes:

- [`centrality_local_efficiency()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_efficiency.md)
  — Latora & Marchiori (2001). Global efficiency of the subgraph induced
  on a node’s neighbours, the node removed. Matches
  `brainGraph::efficiency(type = "local")` and the networkx
  induced-subgraph form on 25 random graphs. Note that
  [`igraph::local_efficiency()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/global_efficiency.html)
  measures those distances *through the rest of the network* and so
  reports larger values;
  [`network_local_efficiency()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_local_efficiency.md)
  keeps its igraph parity and its help page now says so.
- [`centrality_s_core()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_efficiency.md)
  — Eidsaa & Almaas (2013). The weighted k-core: the largest strength
  threshold whose core still contains the node. Matches
  [`igraph::coreness()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/coreness.html)
  on unweighted graphs and a brute-force reading of the definition on
  weighted ones.
  [`brainGraph::s_core()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/brainGraph/man/s_core.html)
  returns the peeling round instead, which is documented as a
  divergence.
- [`centrality_fragmentation()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_efficiency.md)
  — Borgatti (2006). Distance-weighted fragmentation after deleting the
  node; matches
  [`keyplayer::fragment()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/keyplayer/man/fragment.html).
  This is the Zoo’s “Distance-weighted fragmentation”, taking cograph’s
  Zoo coverage to 103 of 349.
- [`centrality_kpath()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_efficiency.md)
  — Sade (1989). Simple paths of length at most `kpath_len` that the
  node lies on; matches the per-vertex counts of
  [`sna::kpath.census()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sna/man/path.census.html)
  for k = 2 and 3, directed and undirected.
- [`centrality_epc()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_efficiency.md)
  — Lin et al. (2008), the cytoHubba edge percolated component. Recovers
  the exact bond-percolation mean on small graphs and matches the
  normalisation of
  [`centiserve::epc()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/epc.html).
  Monte Carlo: pass `epc_seed` for a reproducible value; the caller’s
  random stream is restored.

`fragmentation` and `epc` join the costly list, so `type = "all"` holds
them back (`include = "costly"` or naming them restores them).

Three of the reported gaps turned out not to be gaps at all, and the
document now says so with the evidence:
[`centiserve::closeness.latora()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/closeness.latora.html)
is cograph’s `harmonic` exactly,
[`centiserve::communibet()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/communibet.html)
is `communicability_betweenness` exactly, and
`brainGraph::efficiency(type = "nodal")` is `harmonic` over `n - 1`. Two
remain unimplemented and are listed with the reason: the link-community
centrality of Kalinka & Tomancak (its reference package `linkcomm` is
archived, so no equivalence check is possible) and
[`keyplayer::kpset()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/keyplayer/man/kpset.html) (a
set search, not a node measure).

#### Centrality Batch 11 — tuning the families cograph already had

160 of the Zoo’s measures sit at a rank correlation of 0.90 or better
with something
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
already computes (`docs/zoo/parameter_candidates.csv`), which suggests
many are the same family at a different setting rather than different
ideas. The first five investigated bear that out, and four new measures
plus two arguments cover seven more Zoo labels (coverage 103 -\> 110 of
349):

- [`centrality_length_scaled_betweenness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_length_scaled_betweenness.md)
  — Borgatti & Everett (2006), Brandes (2008) Algorithm 5. Betweenness
  with each separated pair weighted by `1 / d(s,t)`.
- [`centrality_delta_betweenness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_length_scaled_betweenness.md)
  — Agneessens, Borgatti & Everett (2017). Betweenness with the pair
  weight `(d - 1)^-delta` (`betweenness_delta`, default 1); `delta = 0`
  is ordinary betweenness.
- [`centrality_ego_betweenness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_length_scaled_betweenness.md)
  — Everett & Borgatti (2005). Betweenness inside the node’s own ego
  network. Close to `effective_size`, and a test pins that it is not a
  function of it.
- [`centrality_delta_closeness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_length_scaled_betweenness.md)
  — Agneessens et al. (2017) eq. 2. `sum_j d_ij^-delta / (n-1)`
  (`closeness_delta`, default 1). One exponent spans the family:
  `delta = 1` is `harmonic` over `n-1`, `delta = 2` is `harary` over
  `n-1`, a large `delta` approaches degree, `delta = 0` counts the
  reachable set.
- **Bounded-distance (“k-”) betweenness needs no new measure**:
  `centrality(x, measures = "betweenness", cutoff = k)` already computes
  it, verified against a brute-force reading of the definition on
  directed and undirected graphs. It is now mapped as covered.

All four are exact under a brute-force enumeration of weighted geodesic
pairs (`local_testing_and_equivalence/batch11/run_equivalence.R`, 6
blocks, 6 PASS).

### Bug fixes

- **`gravity` computed a formula that appears in no paper.** It summed
  `deg(j) * kshell(j) / d(i,j)^2` over every reachable `j`: the product
  of two masses on the partner, none on the focal node, and no
  truncation. Its help page cited Li et al. (2019), whose formula is
  `k_i k_j / d^2`. Dropping the focal mass changes the ranking, not just
  the scale. The measure now computes `m_i m_j / d^exponent` and gains
  two arguments: `gravity_mass` (`"kshell"` default, `"degree"`, or
  `"legacy"`) and `gravity_radius` (a number, default 3, `"auto"` for
  half the mean distance, or `NULL`). The default is now Ma, Ma, Zhang &
  Wang (2016); `gravity_mass = "degree", gravity_radius = NULL` is Li et
  al.’s gravity model and `gravity_radius = "auto"` their local gravity
  model, so one measure covers three Zoo labels. **`gravity` returns
  different values than in 2.4.7 and earlier**;
  `gravity_mass = "legacy"` with `gravity_radius = NULL` reproduces the
  old numbers exactly, and a test pins that.

## cograph 2.4.6

### New features

- [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) on a
  `netobject` with `method = "entropy"` (Nestimate’s
  [`entropy_network()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/entropy_network.html))
  now receives TNA styling — oval layout, TNA palette,
  initial-probability donuts — instead of falling through to psych
  styling, so the entropy re-weighting of a transition network renders
  comparably with its source.

- [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) now
  accepts `label_abbrev`, matching `mcml`: use an integer for a fixed
  maximum label length, `"auto"` for node-count-aware abbreviation, or
  `NULL` to retain full labels.

- **Producer-supplied splot metadata** (`x$meta$splot`): packages that
  create cograph-plottable objects can now attach a small rendering
  contract — `renderer` (resolved through a cograph-maintained whitelist
  of existing renderers; arbitrary function names are never evaluated),
  `weight` (which stored edge quantity to render: an edge column keeps
  the producer’s edge set, a matrix redefines the drawn network from its
  nonzero cells, aligned by dimnames), and `defaults` (renderer
  arguments). Precedence is always
  `user arguments > meta$splot$defaults > cograph defaults`; on the
  regular network path this includes deprecated argument aliases (a
  user-supplied `positive_color` still beats a metadata
  `edge_positive_color` default). See
  [`?splot`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md), section
  “Producer-Supplied splot Metadata”.

### Bug fixes / changes

- **Motif subsystem overhaul** following an adversarial review (13
  findings, each verified against igraph before fixing):

  - **[`motif_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motif_census.md)
    mislabeled 13 of the 16 directed triad classes**: it attached
    MAN-order names to
    [`igraph::motifs()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/motifs.html)
    output, which is in igraph’s isomorphism-class order (a pure 021U
    triad was reported as `102`). The directed 3-node census now uses
    [`igraph::triad_census()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/triad_census.html),
    whose ordering *is* MAN order. Counts were internally consistent —
    z-scores compared like with like — but carried the wrong names.
    [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md),
    [`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md)
    and
    [`triad_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/triad_census.md)
    were never affected.
  - The undirected census gains the missing one-edge class
    (`empty`/`edge`/`wedge`/`triangle`), and self-loops are stripped
    before counting (they are not part of any 3-node class).
  - The `"configuration"` null model now uses exact degree-preserving
    edge rewiring. The old stub-matching +
    [`simplify()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/simplify.md)
    silently changed degrees, and the undirected `"vl"` sampler errored
    on graphs with isolates and restricted the ensemble to connected
    graphs (two disconnected triangles got `sd = 0, z = 0, p = 1` for an
    observation the null could never produce).
  - All motif p-values are now **empirical permutation p-values**
    (add-one corrected) instead of Gaussian approximations, and a
    degenerate null (sd = 0) yields `z = NA` when the observation
    differs from it — never a silent `z = 0`. Zero-variance handling was
    previously inconsistent across the three engines (forced 0 / sd := 1
    / sd := 0.1). `n_random` / `n_perm` below 2 is now an error.
  - `motifs(pattern = "all")` now actually includes the `003` class; a
    full census sums to `choose(n, 3)` and matches
    [`igraph::triad_census()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/triad_census.html)
    class by class.
  - Instance-mode significance
    ([`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md))
    now tests the null probability that a triple instantiates **the
    row’s own MAN type**; the old null counted “any of the six edges
    exists” (for ten subjects each with a 3-cycle, expected was 8.33
    instead of the correct 3.33).
  - Instance mode reports one row per (triple, MAN type) instead of
    collapsing to a dominant type, so per-type totals now agree with
    census mode on identical data.
  - Instance-mode significance on aggregate input (a single matrix) now
    warns and reports `params$significance = FALSE` instead of silently
    returning results without the promised `z`/`p` columns.
  - Census significance on a symmetric directed matrix now runs a
    directed null (previously the undirected `empty`/`wedge`/`triangle`
    names never matched a MAN row, yielding all-NA statistics).
  - `extract_motifs(level = "aggregate")` now actually pools the
    per-individual transition matrices (previously only metadata
    changed), and `min_transitions` applies per-triad at aggregate level
    as documented.
  - `motif_census(x, directed = ...)` conflicting with an igraph input’s
    own directedness is now an error instead of relabeling without
    converting.
  - `edge_method = "percent"` thresholds above 1 are percentages and the
    comparison is `>=` as documented (the old `> total * 1.5` default
    could never classify anything); fractional edge weights are rounded,
    not truncated, when building permutation stubs.
  - `plot.cograph_motifs(type = "network")` forwards `...` to the
    per-motif igraph plots as documented, and pattern-panel significance
    decoration is suppressed for legacy per-triple results where a
    per-type lookup would be ambiguous.
  - A Monte Carlo equivalence suite now validates the whole subsystem on
    1000 generated datasets per run — 18 topologies (random, scale-free,
    small-world, rings, stars, tournaments, DAGs, bipartite blocks,
    disconnected, isolates, empty), 3-60 nodes, directed / weighted /
    undirected / multi-actor inputs — against
    [`igraph::triad_census()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/triad_census.html),
    brute-force triple enumeration, and per-actor reference censuses.
  - The legacy
    [`extract_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_motifs.md)
    individual-level path now retains one row per
    `(node triple, MAN type)` and tests that exact type under the same
    weighted stub-matching null as individual-level
    [`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md).
    It no longer collapses mixed-type triples to a dominant label or
    counts any permuted type as a match.
  - Fractional transition data now produce balanced integer in/out
    stubs; low-activity units (including one-transition and empty units
    when allowed) participate correctly in instance nulls, and
    one-element stub vectors are shuffled without R’s `sample(x)`
    length-one ambiguity. Unit eligibility is frozen from the original
    loopless weighted activity, and every positive edge retains support
    during integerization.
  - `sig`, printing, and motif plot colors now consistently follow the
    empirical permutation decision (`p < .05`) instead of mixing it with
    `|z| > 1.96` or `|z| > 2` cutoffs. Parallel edges are simplified
    before
    [`motif_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motif_census.md)
    so observed and null graphs use the same simple-graph projection.
  - Instance results now include structured `node1` / `node2` / `node3`
    columns in addition to the existing `triad` display label, so node
    names containing `" - "` remain unambiguous in statistics and plots.
  - Directed size-4 motif rows now use one consistent `M1`–`M218` naming
    sequence covering all igraph isomorphism slots (199 are connected),
    and `directed=` conflicts are rejected consistently for both igraph
    and cograph-network inputs.
  - Degenerate-null rows (`z = NA` with the smallest possible empirical
    p, emitted when the observation lies outside a zero-variance null)
    are now treated as the strongest findings everywhere: they rank
    first in sorted results, survive `top = n` cuts instead of being
    silently truncated, and the significance plots report them with a
    message instead of silently dropping them (a z bar cannot be drawn
    for them).
  - `plot(x, type = "triads")` no longer errors on fractional weighted
    counts (e.g. probability matrices at aggregate level); whole numbers
    keep the plain `n=3` caption.
  - Weight validation for permutation nulls applies only to
    null-eligible units, so a malformed cell in a unit excluded by
    `min_transitions` no longer aborts the whole significance run
    (malformed cells in eligible units still error loudly).

- [`plot_transitions()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_transitions.md)
  with a multi-column data frame (the consecutive multi-step branch) no
  longer silently drops styling arguments: `value_min`, `label_color`,
  `label_fontface`, `label_nudge`, `title_color`, `title_fontface`,
  `value_halo`, `value_fontface`, `value_nudge`, and `total_fontface`
  are now forwarded, so both multi-step input forms (list of matrices,
  data frame) respond to the same arguments identically.

- Motif pattern plots (`plot(motifs(x), type = "network")`, triad glyph
  panels) drew the wrong structure for five of the sixteen MAN triad
  classes: the `021D` and `021U` glyphs were swapped (transposed
  matrices), the `120D` and `120U` glyphs both drew a `120C`-isomorphic
  triad, and the `210` glyph drew a `120`-class triad — so the `120U`
  and `210` structures were never drawn at all. Only the drawn glyphs
  were wrong: motif *counts*, significance tests, and
  [`triad_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/triad_census.md)
  were always computed from a separate, correct canonical pattern set
  (verified against
  [`igraph::triad_census()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/triad_census.html)).
  All sixteen visual patterns are now verified against igraph by a
  regression test that also pins the visual and canonical sets to each
  other. Thanks to Mengli Zhang for reporting (reconstructing the
  structures from the package source and spotting that three “distinct”
  glyphs were isomorphic).

- [`plot_bootstrap_forest()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_bootstrap_forest.md),
  [`extract_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_motifs.md),
  [`motif_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motif_census.md),
  [`triad_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/triad_census.md)
  and
  [`extract_triads()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_triads.md)
  are now listed in the package index and the reference site. All five
  are exported and user-facing, but carried `@keywords internal`, which
  hid them from
  [`help(package = "cograph")`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference) —
  you could only find them if you already knew the name.
  [`mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/mcml.md) remains
  hidden; it is a deprecated alias of
  [`csum()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/csum.md). The `n` and
  `...` arguments of
  [`print.cograph_motif_analysis()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_motifs.md)
  and
  [`print.cograph_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motif_census.md)
  are now documented (previously exempt from checking by the `internal`
  keyword).

- [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)’s
  new `difference` argument moved to the end of the signature, after
  `combined`. It had been inserted *before* `combined`, which shifted
  the positional argument order relative to the released 2.3.6
  signature. Because
  [`plot_compare()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_compare.md)
  is `function(x, ...)` and forwards to
  [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md),
  a caller passing 14 positional arguments had their 14th silently
  rebound from `combined` to `difference` — making the function treat
  `x` as an already-subtracted matrix, discard `y`, and draw the wrong
  network with no error. `difference` was introduced after the last CRAN
  release, so no released behaviour changes. Named calls were never
  affected.

- [`plot_bootstrap_forest()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_bootstrap_forest.md)
  and
  [`plot_edge_diff_forest()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_edge_diff_forest.md)
  no longer emit a `geom_errorbarh()` deprecation warning under ggplot2
  4.0.0. The four horizontal error-bar layers now use
  `geom_errorbar(orientation = "y")`; the rendered output is unchanged.
  `DESCRIPTION` now declares the `ggplot2 (>= 3.4.0)` requirement the
  package already had (it uses the `linewidth` aesthetic throughout).

- `plot_edge_diff_forest(layout = "chord")` no longer emits a spurious
  “row names were found from a short variable and have been discarded”
  warning for every node arc it draws.

- [`aggregate_layers()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/aggregate_layers.md),
  [`supra_adjacency()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/supra_adjacency.md),
  [`layer_similarity_matrix()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/layer_similarity_matrix.md)
  and
  [`plot_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_motifs.md)
  now ship runnable examples. Their `\examples` sections were previously
  commented out (or entirely `\dontrun`), so they demonstrated nothing
  and were never checked. The remaining `\dontrun` blocks in
  [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md) and
  [`extract_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_motifs.md)
  are now `\donttest`, so they are executed under
  `R CMD check --run-donttest`.

- [`detect_communities()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/detect_communities.md)
  with the `"louvain"` (the default) or `"leiden"` method no longer
  errors on a **directed** graph. These igraph algorithms are
  undirected-only, so `detect_communities(tna_object)` — a tna model is
  always directed — aborted with “Multi-level community detection works
  for undirected graphs only”. It now collapses the directed edges to
  undirected (mean, as the `"fast_greedy"` method already did) with a
  message, so the package’s primary object type works with the default
  algorithm. This also fixes `plot_htna(x, community = "louvain")` and
  other internal callers that ran community detection on a directed
  model.

- [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) on a
  Nestimate `netdifference` (from
  [`subtract_networks()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/subtract_networks.html)
  /
  [`as_netdifference()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/as_netdifference.html))
  now routes to
  [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md).
  Previously it fell through to the `netobject` path, which styles by
  `$method` — “difference” is not a TNA-family method, so the asymmetric
  difference matrix was drawn with undirected psych styling: no
  arrowheads and one triangle of each asymmetric edge pair silently
  dropped. `splot(d, minimum = 3)` is now the straightforward call for a
  signed difference network.

- The `netdifference` routing excludes `net_permutation`-family objects:
  `net_bayes` carries both classes and must keep reaching
  `splot.net_permutation`, whose per-edge CI/star arrays are aligned by
  [`Nestimate::plot.net_bayes`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/plot.net_bayes.html)
  to that renderer’s edge ordering.

- [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  on a `netdifference` now draws the display matrix (`$weights` —
  e.g. only the credible differences when coerced with
  `as_netdifference(b, significant_only = TRUE)`), falling back to
  `$difference_matrix`. For
  [`subtract_networks()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/subtract_networks.html)
  results the two are identical, so nothing changes there.

- [`plot_permutation()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_permutation.md)
  /
  [`splot.net_permutation()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md):
  the `title` and `layout` defaults now use exact `[[` indexing.
  `args$title` on a dots-list holding `title_size` (but no `title`)
  partially matched `title_size`, so the default title was silently
  skipped and no title was drawn — this is why
  [`Nestimate::plot.net_bayes()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/plot.net_bayes.html)
  output had no title. Same latent hazard fixed for `layout` /
  `layout_scale`.

- Edge label templates gain a `{p_diff}` placeholder (probability of the
  difference, for Bayesian comparisons), fed by the new
  `edge_label_p_diff` argument — a per-edge vector or a full
  node-by-node matrix (the matrix is indexed at each drawn edge, so it
  survives `minimum`/`threshold` filtering, and is aligned by dimnames
  so it may be supplied in any node order). Filled automatically from
  `$p_difference` by `splot.net_permutation` and by
  [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  on Bayesian `netdifference` coercions. Template example:
  `edge_label_template = "{est} (P={p_diff})"`.

- [`splot.netobject()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md)
  styling classifier: `"edge_betweenness"` networks are now styled by
  their directedness. A directed edge-betweenness network previously
  fell into psych styling — drawn undirected, silently losing one
  direction of each asymmetric pair; it now gets the TNA presets with
  arrows. An undirected one (from a correlation-family source —
  Nestimate preserves the source’s directedness) keeps the psych look.

- Nestimate producers now use the `meta$splot` contract: `netdifference`
  objects carry `renderer = "difference"` and `net_bayes` carries
  `renderer = "permutation"`, so metadata routing (which runs before
  class dispatch) selects the renderer; the `netdifference` class branch
  remains as a fallback for objects built without metadata.

## cograph 2.4.3

### Bug fixes / changes

- [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  no longer hides small difference edges: it defaults `minimum = 0` (the
  style presets otherwise injected `minimum = 0.01`, silently dropping
  edges with `|x - y| < 0.01`). An explicit `minimum` still wins.

- `plot_difference(x, y, difference = TRUE)` now warns that `y` is
  ignored and uses `x` as the difference network, instead of silently
  computing `x - y`.

## cograph 2.4.2

### Bug fixes / changes

- [`plot_compare()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_compare.md)
  is **no longer deprecated** — it is a plain alias of
  [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md).
  [`tna::plot_compare()`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/plot_compare.md)
  delegates to it by name (`cograph::plot_compare(x, y, ...)`), so
  deprecating it wrongly made every
  [`tna::plot_compare()`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/plot_compare.md)
  call emit a warning; the warning is removed. Both names call the same
  implementation;
  [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  is the preferred spelling for new cograph code.

- [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  also auto-detects a Nestimate `netdifference` object (or any object
  exposing `$difference_matrix`), alongside `tna_comparison`.

## cograph 2.4.1

### New features

- [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  can now consume a **pre-computed difference network**: a
  `tna_comparison` object (from
  [`tna::compare()`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/compare.md)) is
  detected automatically and its `$difference_matrix` is plotted, and
  `difference = TRUE` treats `x` as an already-subtracted matrix/network
  (no `y` needed). The two-network `plot_difference(x, y)` path is
  unchanged.

## cograph 2.4.0

### New features

- Two focal-node flow layouts, usable anywhere a layout name is accepted
  (`splot(x, layout = "target")` / `layout = "saqr"`):
  - [`layout_target()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/layout_target.md)
    ports qgraph’s [`flow()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/qgraph/man/flow.html)
    — places one node of interest (`target =`) on the left and every
    other node in columns by unweighted BFS distance (hops). Unlike
    qgraph it handles disconnected graphs (isolated nodes go to a
    trailing column) instead of erroring.
  - [`layout_saqr()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/layout_saqr.md)
    ports the Dynalytics Desktop “saqr” transition layout (Saqr et al.,
    LAK25): Start on top, End on bottom, middle nodes ranked by outgoing
    weight from Start and split into 2–3 sine-enveloped rows with a
    zig-zag first row (`start =`, `end =`, `jitter =`).

### Bug fixes / changes

- [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  now **styles the difference network automatically** instead of drawing
  bare default-blue nodes: an undirected difference gets the
  psychometric look (Okabe-Ito node palette, no arrows, thin edges), a
  directed difference gets the TNA look (TNA palette, arrows). Node size
  uses the calibrated preset (previously nodes could render
  near-invisible), and edges stay coloured by the sign of the
  difference. Explicit `node_*` arguments still override the preset.

- [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  is added as the preferred name for the difference-network plotter.
  [`plot_compare()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_compare.md)
  remains a first-class alias of it
  ([`tna::plot_compare()`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/plot_compare.md)
  delegates to
  [`cograph::plot_compare()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_compare.md)
  by name, so the name must keep working).

- [`plot_difference()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_difference.md)
  (the renamed difference-network plotter) now treats an S3
  `cograph_network` (which is itself a list — e.g. a `psychnet` fit, a
  Nestimate `netobject`, or any
  [`as_cograph()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/as_cograph.md)
  result) as a single network. Previously such an object fell into the
  “plain list of networks” branch and was misread as a list of
  sub-networks, failing with “x must be a matrix, cograph_network, tna,
  or igraph object”. Comparing two psychnet/netobject networks with
  `plot_difference(net1, net2)` now works.

## cograph 2.3.11

### New features

- [`dyad_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/dyad_census.md)
  classifies every dyad of a directed network into mutual (M),
  asymmetric (A), or null (N), returning a tidy one-row-per-type
  data.frame with counts and proportions and a dyad-based reciprocity
  (`2M / (2M + A)`) attribute. It is the dyad-level companion to
  [`triad_census()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/triad_census.md).
  Undirected input counts every edge as a mutual dyad.

- [`ego_networks()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/ego_networks.md)
  reports tidy per-ego personal-network metrics — size, ego/alter tie
  counts and densities, and Burt’s structural-hole measures
  (`effective_size`, `constraint`, `order = 1` only) — with one row per
  ego. The structural-hole columns reuse the same implementations as
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md),
  so they match
  `centrality(x, measures = c("effective_size", "constraint"))` exactly.

## cograph 2.3.10

### Bug fixes / changes

- Bootstrap plots of undirected co-occurrence networks
  (`splot.net_bootstrap`) now default to the `"oval"` layout instead of
  the force-directed `"spring"` layout, matching `splot.tna_bootstrap`.
  Pass `layout = "spring"` to restore the previous behavior.

- Bootstrap plots now auto-suppress the `".00"` decimal tail on
  integer-valued weight matrices (co-occurrence counts, raw
  frequencies): `266.00**` renders as `266**`. Detection mirrors
  `splot.netobject` — when every nonzero weight is a whole number and
  the user has not set `weight_digits`, both `weight_digits` and
  `edge_label_digits` default to `0`. Applies to both
  `splot.net_bootstrap` and `splot.tna_bootstrap`. Non-integer
  (correlation/GLASSO) networks are unaffected, and an explicit
  `weight_digits` always wins.

## cograph 2.3.9

### New features

- [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  gains a `theme` argument: `"classic"` (default — the established
  pie-node / straight-edge look, now with thinner node and shell borders
  and slightly larger detail nodes), `"rich"` (donut nodes on both
  layers plus curved summary edges and splot self-loops), and `"light"`
  (`"rich"` with no shell outline and a softer fill). Granular overrides
  `node_donut`, `node_donut_inner_ratio`, `summary_donut_inner_ratio`,
  `summary_donut_show_value`, `curved_edges`, and `summary_curve` win
  over the preset.

- [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  now colors edges by weight sign on every layer (within-cluster,
  between-cluster, summary, and self-loops) via `edge_color_by`:
  `"auto"` (default) keeps cluster coloring for non-negative transition
  networks but switches to sign coloring when any negative weight is
  present (correlation / association networks), `"cluster"` and `"sign"`
  force either mode. Positive edges use `edge_positive_color`
  (`"#2E7D32"`, green) and negative edges `edge_negative_color`
  (`"#C62828"`, red), matching
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md). Edge
  visibility thresholding and width scaling now use the absolute weight,
  so negative edges are drawn rather than silently dropped, and a
  positive/negative key is added to the legend when sign coloring is
  active.

- [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  summary-node labels are now placed “on the clock”: each label sits
  just outside its node in the cardinal direction the node points from
  the arrangement center (top at 12, bottom at 6, left at 9, right at
  3), anchored at the node boundary so it always clears the node
  regardless of `summary_size`. An explicit `summary_label_position`
  still overrides this.

## cograph 2.3.8

### New features

- [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  and [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) accept
  `mcml_pc` objects
  ([`Nestimate::build_mcml_pc()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_mcml_pc.html),
  experimental psychometric MCML) and render them undirected via their
  `meta$directed` flag.

## cograph 2.3.7

### Breaking changes

- The exported names
  [`cluster_summary()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_summary.html)
  and
  [`build_mcml()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_mcml.html)
  are removed to end, permanently, the collision with
  [`Nestimate::cluster_summary()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_summary.html)
  and
  [`Nestimate::build_mcml()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_mcml.html)
  — different functions that silently masked each other depending on
  package attach order (the same disease as the
  [`cluster_network()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_network.html)
  alias removed in 2.3.6, where load order silently flipped results
  between raw counts and row-normalized probabilities). Migration is
  name-for-name with identical behavior:
  - `cluster_summary(...)` → `csum(...)` (the existing short alias is
    now the canonical exported name; same arguments, same
    `cluster_summary` return object).
  - `build_mcml(...)` → `summarize_clusters(...)` (same arguments, same
    `mcml` return object). In sessions where both packages are attached,
    the bare names
    [`cluster_summary()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_summary.html)
    /
    [`build_mcml()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_mcml.html)
    now always refer to Nestimate’s data-layer verbs, regardless of
    attach order. The
    [`as_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/as_tna.md)
    generic is intentionally exported by both packages: the definitions
    are identical (`function(x) UseMethod("as_tna")`), so masking is
    harmless and S3 methods from both packages dispatch correctly.

### New features

- [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  gains a `directed` argument (default `NULL` = auto-detect). Undirected
  rendering suppresses arrowheads on all three edge layers
  (within-cluster, between-cluster, summary), draws each symmetric edge
  pair once instead of twice (previously a symmetric matrix produced
  overplotted reciprocal arrows), and moves edge labels to the edge
  midpoint. Auto-detection reads `$meta$directed` from
  `cluster_summary`/`mcml` input (e.g., co-occurrence aggregations such
  as `Nestimate::build_mcml(type = "cooccurrence")` now render
  undirected with no extra flag), the `$directed` field of network
  objects, or matrix symmetry for plain matrices — the same contract as
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md), which
  forwards `directed` when dispatching `mcml`/`cluster_summary` objects.
- [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  undirected matrix input is aggregated with
  `cluster_summary(type = "cooccurrence")` (symmetrized counts) instead
  of the row-normalized `type = "tna"`, whose output is asymmetric even
  for symmetric input and cannot be represented by undirected drawing.
  When `directed = FALSE` is forced on weights that are not symmetric,
  [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  now warns that only the upper triangle is drawn.

### Bug fixes

- [`cluster_summary()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_summary.html)
  and the sequence path of
  [`build_mcml()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_mcml.html)
  now record the *effective* directedness in `$meta$directed`: `FALSE`
  when `type = "cooccurrence"` (which symmetrizes the weights), instead
  of echoing the `directed` argument unchanged.

## cograph 2.3.6

CRAN release: 2026-05-31

### Bug fixes

- Removed the
  [`cluster_network()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_network.html)
  alias for
  [`summarize_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/summarize_network.md).
  It collided with
  [`Nestimate::cluster_network()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_network.html)
  — a completely different function (PAM clustering on sequence data,
  one network per cluster) — and the two silently masked each other
  depending on package attach order, producing confusing
  `unused arguments (k = ..., cluster_by = ...)` errors. Use
  [`summarize_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/summarize_network.md)
  (or its remaining short form
  [`cnet()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/summarize_network.md))
  for matrix-to-cluster aggregation in cograph.

## cograph 2.3.5

### Documentation

- Added Sonsoles López-Pernas as co-copyright holder in `LICENSE`.
- README / docs wording fixes (e.g. “hyper order” → “higher-order”).
- Introduction vignette no longer asserts a fixed centrality-measure
  count, which kept drifting as the measure set grew.

## cograph 2.3.4

### Bug fixes

- `.smooth_blob()` (used by
  [`plot_simplicial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_simplicial.md)
  and
  [`overlay_communities()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/overlay_communities.md))
  now guards
  [`grDevices::chull()`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/chull.html) against
  non-finite anchor coordinates. Previously a node lacking layout
  coordinates (NA/Inf) aborted the blob with “finite coordinates are
  needed”; such anchors are now dropped before the convex-hull step.

## cograph 2.3.3

### Documentation

- Aligned the
  [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md) /
  [`subgraphs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/subgraphs.md)
  roxygen documentation with the post-audit behavior shipped in 2.3.2
  (census `type_summary` counts, `min_count` handling, and corrected
  plot legend descriptions).

## cograph 2.3.2

### Bug fixes

- Full audit pass over the motifs subsystem: `type_summary` now holds
  real MAN-type counts in census mode, `min_count` is honored in census
  mode, and the swapped source/target color description in
  [`plot.cograph_motif_result()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md)
  is corrected.
- Unbroke [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md)
  and
  [`plot_simplicial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_simplicial.md)
  on Nestimate-backed workflows (HON / HYPA sequence inputs).
- [`panel_layout()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/panel_layout.md):
  tightened dimension validation and made the restoration claim honest —
  it now restores only the
  [`par()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/par.html) settings it actually
  changed.

## cograph 2.3.1

### Multi-panel layout control

- New `combined` argument (default `TRUE`) on every multi-panel plot
  function: [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md)
  group-cascade,
  [`plot_netobject_group()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_netobject_group.md),
  [`plot_netobject_ml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_netobject_ml.md),
  [`plot_net_bootstrap_group()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_net_bootstrap_group.md),
  [`plot_group_permutation()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_group_permutation.md),
  [`plot_compare()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_compare.md),
  [`splot.net_mlvar()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md),
  [`plot_network_evolution()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_network_evolution.md),
  [`plot.cograph_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot.cograph_motifs.md),
  [`plot.cograph_motif_result()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md),
  [`plot.cograph_motif_analysis()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot.cograph_motif_analysis.md),
  and
  [`plot.tna_disparity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot.tna_disparity.md).
  With `combined = FALSE` these functions draw panels into the active
  device without calling `graphics::par(mfrow=...)`, so callers can
  drive their own layout
  (e.g. [`graphics::layout()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/layout.html)
  or the new
  [`panel_layout()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/panel_layout.md)
  helper). Default `TRUE` preserves prior behavior — every existing call
  site renders identically.
- New
  [`panel_layout()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/panel_layout.md)
  helper sets up a custom multi-panel device layout for use with
  `combined = FALSE`. Accepts either a uniform-grid `c(nrow, ncol)` or a
  [`graphics::layout()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/layout.html) matrix
  for non-uniform layouts (e.g. one wide panel + two narrow ones).
  Returns a [`par()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/par.html) snapshot for
  restoration via [`on.exit()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/on.exit.html).

### Test suite hygiene

- `test-coverage-splot-{41,42}.R`: bumped `n_nodes` from 4 to 10 in
  seven per-edge attribute tests so the seed=42 sampler does not produce
  duplicate (1,2) pairs that trip cograph’s undirected-duplicate-edge
  detector.
- `test-coverage-class-network-41.R`: aligned the `set_layout_coords()`
  mismatched-row-count test with the strict input validation already
  enforced by `R/class-network.R`.
- `test-overlay-communities.R`: prefixed two
  [`communities()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/communities.md)
  calls with `cograph::` to avoid `tna` masking when both packages are
  loaded in the suite (per CLAUDE.md “namespace masking” gotcha).

## cograph 2.3.0

### Documentation

- Audited every R/\*.R function file for roxygen/Rd accuracy. Corrected
  stale defaults (`cr_color` `#D4820A` -\> `#D4829A` in `plot-forest.R`;
  `show_value` default `FALSE` -\> `TRUE` in `splot-nodes.R`), corrected
  dataset dimensions in `data-hai.R` (`302` -\> `429 x 287`), corrected
  a reference to the nonexistent
  [`igraph::is_bipartite()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/is_bipartite.html)
  (now `bipartite_mapping()`), expanded
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  `@param` measure lists for `mode`, `cutoff`, `invert_weights`, and
  `membership` to match the implementation, dropped baked-in measure
  counts that rot on each addition, and removed nonexistent themes from
  `sn_theme` documentation. No runtime behavior changes from the
  documentation pass itself.

### Bug fixes

- [`plot_simplicial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_simplicial.md)
  now warns when `anomaly` is set on an input that has no anomaly
  concept (HON, association rules, link prediction, character pathways,
  `method = "hon"` / `"rules"`). Previously the argument was silently
  dropped, so calls like `plot_simplicial(hon, anomaly = "over")` and
  `plot_simplicial(hon, anomaly = "under")` produced byte-identical
  plots. `anomaly` is honored only for `net_hypa` inputs and
  `method = "hypa"` auto-builds.

### Centrality

- [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  gains an umbrella argument `tna_network` (logical or NULL). When
  `TRUE` (or auto-detected from a `tna`/`group_tna`/`ctna`/
  `ftna`/`atna` input), all measures shared with
  [`tna::centralities()`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/centralities.md)
  match byte-for-byte: `loops = FALSE`, `invert_weights = TRUE`,
  `diffusion_method = "power_series"`, `transitivity_type = "onnela"`.
  Side-by-side audit confirms zero divergence on `OutStrength`,
  `InStrength`, `ClosenessIn/Out/All`, `Betweenness`, `Diffusion`,
  `Clustering` (`max|diff| = 0`). Any per-argument override the user
  passes explicitly always wins over the umbrella.
- [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  (and
  [`centrality_diffusion()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_diffusion.md))
  gain a `diffusion_method = c("kandhway_kuri", "power_series")`
  argument. The default `NULL` auto-detects: `"power_series"` for tna
  inputs (matches `tna::centralities(., measures = "Diffusion")`
  byte-for-byte when `loops = FALSE`), `"kandhway_kuri"` (the existing
  1-hop binary-degree formula, Kandhway & Kuri 2014) for everything
  else. Previously cograph’s diffusion silently disagreed with tna’s
  because cograph used an unweighted neighborhood-degree sum while tna
  uses `rowSums(P + P^2 + ... + P^n)` on the diagonal-zeroed weighted
  matrix — the same name covered two different statistics. Set
  explicitly to override the auto-detect.

### Tests

- Added a regression test in
  `tests/testthat/test-validate-nestimate-bootstrap-permutation.R`
  asserting that
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  on a Nestimate `netobject` agrees with
  [`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
  on its `$weights` matrix when the diagonal is non-zero. Locks in the
  upstream Nestimate fix to `.extract_edges_from_matrix()` (Nestimate
  \>= 2026-05-02) which now preserves self-loops in `$edges`. Without
  that fix, loop-bearing netobjects
  (e.g. `Nestimate::build_mcml() |> Nestimate::as_tna()`) silently
  under-counted node degree by 2.

### Plotting — edge-label cex coupling (Phase 2)

- Default `edge_label_size` is now coupled to the node label cex at a
  fixed 0.55 fraction (`edge_cex = 0.55 * mean(node_label_cex)`) so the
  node-to-edge-label ratio stays a stable ~1.82x across canvases. This
  replaces the previous `EDGE_LABEL_SCALE_CAP`-based compensation, which
  let the ratio drift from 2.5x at reference to 3.6x at poster canvases
  because edge labels were clamped to a tighter 1.6 ceiling while node
  labels scaled freely to 2.3. The visible effect: edge weight
  annotations are now readable at poster sizes instead of shrinking
  relative to node labels. User-explicit `edge_label_size` still wins
  and receives the same (capped) visual-scale compensation as before;
  only the default path changed.
- Edge-label visual_scale resolution moved from `render_edges_splot()`
  into `splot.R` so the final cex is produced in a single place.

### Plotting — device-aware visual scaling

- [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) now
  applies device-dependent compensation to text, line, and point sizes
  so visual ratios (label-to-node, legend-to-plot, edge thickness) stay
  consistent when the output device changes. This fixes the
  long-standing “labels too big at high DPI” and “legend desynchronised
  from the plot” issues when saving PNGs at `res = 300` or `res = 600`
  with pixel-default `width`/`height`, and when resizing the RStudio
  plot pane. Implementation: a single `compute_visual_scale()` reads the
  active device’s canvas size (`dev.size("in")`) and returns multipliers
  keyed off a 5.9-inch reference (matching the default RStudio 7×5” pane
  so backward-compatible behaviour at the default canvas is preserved).
  Multipliers are clamped to `[0.55, 1.9]` to keep thumbnails and
  posters legible. See the new `R/visual-scale.R`.
- New `scaling = "fixed"` mode on
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) — and
  corresponding global option `options(cograph.visual_scaling = FALSE)`
  — disables device compensation for reproducibility-sensitive workflows
  that calibrated against the previous behaviour.
- [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) return
  value now carries two attributes for downstream tooling:
  `cograph.visual_scale` (the multiplier list) and
  `cograph.node_diam_in` (the representative node diameter in inches at
  the rendered device).
- The splot-internal `render_legend_splot()` plus the new shared
  `.render_legend_base()` (`R/render-legend-shared.R`) replace the
  ad-hoc legend cex/pt.cex handling with a single compensated path.
  `plot_htna`, `plot_mtna`, `plot_mlna`, `plot_mcml` still use their
  historical scale multiplier arguments; Phase 2 will migrate them to
  the shared helper.

### Plotting

- `splot.netobject` now routes on the Nestimate `$method` slot rather
  than just direction. Undirected sequence-based networks from
  [`build_cna()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_cna.html)
  and `wtna(method = "cooccurrence")` get oval TNA-family styling
  (layout, palette, donuts) with arrows and dotted edge starts
  automatically dropped because the matrix is symmetric. Glasso / cor /
  pcor / ising networks still get `psych_styling = TRUE` (spring layout,
  Okabe-Ito palette).
- [`from_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/from_tna.md)
  auto-detects integer-valued weight matrices (ftna, ctna, raw counts)
  and sets `weight_digits = edge_label_digits = 0` so edge labels render
  as `2304` rather than `2304.00`. Fractional weights still format to
  two decimals. Explicit user-supplied `weight_digits` still wins.
- `psych_styling = TRUE` is now exported as a first-class styling preset
  (undirected counterpart of `tna_styling`) — Okabe-Ito palette, spring
  layout, no arrows — applied by default to `splot.netobject` on
  correlation-family input and to the `$contemporaneous` / `$between`
  constituents of `net_mlvar`.
- Expanded [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md)
  dispatch coverage across the tna and Nestimate class hierarchies,
  ensuring `tna`, `ftna`, `ctna`, `group_tna`, `tna_bootstrap`,
  `group_tna_bootstrap`, `tna_permutation`, `group_tna_permutation`,
  `netobject`, `netobject_group`, `netobject_ml`, `net_mlvar`,
  `wtna_mixed`, `net_bootstrap`, `net_permutation`, `boot_glasso`,
  `mcml`, `net_hon`, `net_hypa`, and `simplicial_complex` all reach the
  correct renderer.
- Self-loops are now preserved in every plot function.

### Correctness fixes (audit-driven)

- `detect_duplicate_edges()`, `aggregate_duplicate_edges()`,
  [`simplify.cograph_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/simplify.md),
  and the internal `check_duplicate_edges()` helper now respect directed
  vs undirected semantics. Previously the canonical (min/max) endpoint
  key collapsed `A -> B` and `B -> A` into one edge even on directed
  graphs, matching
  [`igraph::simplify()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/simplify.html)
  ground truth.
- `.compute_modularity()` replaces a nested for loop with cluster-wise
  vectorization
  (`sum(A[idx, idx]) - sum(k_out[idx]) * sum(k_in[idx]) / m`), per the
  project “no for loops” rule. Results verified bit-exact against
  [`igraph::modularity()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/modularity.igraph.html).
- [`is_directed()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/is_directed.md)
  now recognises `CographNetwork` R6 objects — previously only the
  `cograph_network` list format dispatched correctly.
- `compute_layout_for_cograph()` uses `layout$get_type()` instead of the
  removed `$name` field on `CographLayout`.
- [`network_small_world()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/network_small_world.md)
  returns `0` (valid: no triangles means definitively not small-world)
  instead of `NA_real_` when the observed clustering coefficient is zero
  but path length is finite.
- [`simplify.cograph_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/simplify.md)
  threads the directed flag through to edge aggregation so directed
  multigraphs collapse correctly.

### Performance & documentation

- [`simplify()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/simplify.md)
  performance refactor for large networks plus a cleaner
  title-composition path.
- [`motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/motifs.md),
  [`extract_motifs()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/extract_motifs.md),
  and `plot.cograph_motif_analysis` examples reworked to use
  `n_perm = 10L` (or `significance = FALSE`) and promoted from
  `\dontrun` to CRAN-runnable (optional tna branches stay in
  `\donttest`). Retires 320 seconds of latent CRAN timing risk — every
  example now runs in under 4 seconds.

### New tests

- `test-audit-fixes.R` — ground-truth regressions for the directed edge
  semantics, modularity vectorization, and small-world behaviour
  changes.
- `test-integer-weight-labels.R` — locks
  [`from_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/from_tna.md)
  integer-weight auto-detect behaviour and precedence of explicit
  `weight_digits`.
- `test-equiv-{assortativity, cluster-quality, communities, disparity, edge-centrality, network-summary, robustness, standalone-measures}.R`
  — numerical equivalence against igraph, sna, centiserve, brainGraph,
  influenceR, tidygraph, and NetworkX. Gated by
  `skip_coverage_tests() + skip_on_cran()`, so they do not run on the
  CRAN pipeline.

## cograph 2.1.0

### New Features

#### Batch 6 — new-API graph-level / set-level / pair-level measures

These measures don’t fit the per-node
[`centrality()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md)
data frame, so they live as standalone functions:

- [`estrada_index()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/estrada_index.md)
  — graph-level spectral invariant: , equal to the trace of the matrix
  exponential of the adjacency. Equivalently, the sum of
  `subgraph_centrality()` across all nodes. Matches
  `networkx.estrada_index` at machine epsilon (max relative diff ~5e-15
  across random test graphs).
- [`trophic_incoherence()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/trophic_incoherence.md)
  — graph-level food-web stability measure (Johnson et al. 2014).
  Defined as the population standard deviation of per-edge trophic
  differences where is the trophic level of node . Zero for perfectly
  coherent DAGs (e.g., a pure chain). Matches
  `networkx.trophic_incoherence_parameter` at machine epsilon.
  Directed-only; reuses the existing `trophic_level` calculator.
- `group_centrality(x, nodes, measure = c("betweenness", "closeness", "degree"))`
  — Everett-Borgatti (1999) group centrality for a *set* of nodes.
  Returns a scalar. Supports `mode = "in"/"out"` for directed-degree
  variants. **Group closeness and group degree** match
  `networkx.group_*_centrality` bit-exact. **Group betweenness**
  implements the textbook Everett-Borgatti / Puzis 2008 definition
  (fraction of shortest paths passing through at least one node in the
  group), which diverges from `networkx.group_betweenness_centrality` on
  some graphs due to a known quirk in NetworkX’s Puzis-Yahalom-Elovici
  iterative algorithm. Verified via an independent Python brute-force:
  cograph matches the textbook definition; NX produces larger values on
  graphs with many overlapping shortest paths. Documented in the roxygen
  “Divergence from NetworkX” section.
- `dispersion(x, u = NULL, v = NULL, normalized = TRUE, alpha = 1, b = 0, c = 0)`
  — Backstrom-Kleinberg (2014 Facebook) pair-level measure of tie
  strength. Counts the number of “well-dispersed” mutual friends of `u`
  and `v` (pairs of common neighbors that are not directly connected and
  share no common neighbor inside `u`’s ego network other than `u` and
  `v`). Matches `networkx.dispersion` bit-exact across all 156 edges on
  the karate club graph. Returns a scalar, named vector, or data frame
  depending on which of `u`, `v` are specified.

#### Centrality Batch 5 — Gould-Fernandez brokerage (5 roles)

Added the five Gould-Fernandez (1989) brokerage role counts, a
foundational measure in social network analysis (~1500 citations). Each
role is a separate per-node measure requiring a `membership` argument
(following the same pattern as `participation`, `within_module_z`,
`gateway`), and counts open directed 2-paths `a -> v -> c` through
broker `v`:

- [`centrality_brokerage_coordinator()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_coordinator.md)
  — all three in broker’s group (w_I)
- [`centrality_brokerage_itinerant()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_itinerant.md)
  — endpoints same group, broker different (w_O, “consultant”)
- [`centrality_brokerage_representative()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_representative.md)
  — broker + source same, target different (b_IO)
- [`centrality_brokerage_gatekeeper()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_gatekeeper.md)
  — broker + target same, source different (b_OI)
- [`centrality_brokerage_liaison()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_liaison.md)
  — all three in different groups (b_O)

Bit-exact match against `sna::brokerage$raw.nli` for all five roles
across 20 random directed graphs. Implemented natively (no runtime
dependency on sna). Key implementation detail: the Gould-Fernandez
counting rule requires **open 2-paths only** — triads where a direct
edge `a -> c` already exists are excluded. This matches sna’s C
implementation exactly and was derived empirically (sna’s
`.C("brokerage_R", ...)` has no R-level source).

Directed-only; warns and returns `NA` on undirected input.

#### Centrality Batch 4 — directed prestige family (Wasserman-Faust / sna)

- [`centrality_prestige_domain()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_prestige_domain.md)
  — directed-graph prestige measure: for each node , the number of other
  nodes that can reach via a directed path. Classical
  Wasserman-Faust (1994) measure from `sna::prestige(cmode = "domain")`.
  Bit-exact match against sna, implemented natively via
  `igraph::distances(mode = "out")` + `colSums(is.finite(D)) - 1` (no
  runtime dependency on sna). Directed-only; returns NA with a warning
  on undirected input.
- [`centrality_prestige_domain_proximity()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_prestige_domain_proximity.md)
  — distance-weighted variant: `R_v^2 / (D_v * (n - 1))` where `R_v` is
  the number of reachers and `D_v` is the sum of their geodesic
  distances to `v`. Bit-exact match against
  `sna::prestige(cmode = "domain.proximity")` on strongly connected
  directed graphs. On graphs with any unreachable pair, sna has a known
  bug (`FALSE * Inf = NaN` collapses the denominator, producing all-zero
  output); cograph’s
  [`is.finite()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/is.finite.html)-masked formula
  produces mathematically correct values on any directed graph.
  Directed-only.

#### Centrality Batch 3 — classical measures with reference-package validation

- [`centrality_katz()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_katz.md)
  — Katz (1953) status index. Bit-exact match against
  [`centiserve::katzcent`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/katzcent.html)
  (cograph mirrors centiserve’s exact LAPACK call sequence). Also
  matches `igraph::alpha_centrality(exo = 1)` and
  `networkx.katz_centrality_numpy` at machine epsilon. New `katz_alpha`
  parameter (default 0.1).
- [`centrality_hubbell()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_hubbell.md)
  — Hubbell (1965) input-output centrality. Bit-exact match against
  [`centiserve::hubbell`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/hubbell.html)
  (cograph mirrors centiserve’s full-inverse LAPACK call path). Note:
  centiserve’s default (`weights = NULL`) silently ignores
  `E(g)$weight`; to reproduce cograph’s behavior with centiserve on
  weighted graphs, pass `weights = igraph::E(g)$weight` explicitly. New
  `hubbell_weight` parameter (default 0.5).
- [`centrality_information()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_information.md)
  — Stephenson-Zelen (1989) information centrality. Bit-exact match
  against [`sna::infocent`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/sna/man/infocent.html)
  on connected undirected graphs (cograph mirrors sna’s exact
  construction and [`solve()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/solve.html) call
  sequence).
- [`centrality_pairwisedis()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_pairwisedis.md)
  — Pairwise disconnectivity (Potapov et al. 2008). Directed-only;
  fraction of reachable ordered pairs that become unreachable when each
  node is removed. Bit-exact match against
  [`centiserve::pairwisedis`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/centiserve/man/pairwisedis.html).
  Warns and returns `NA` on undirected input, matching the convention
  used by `salsa`, `leaderrank`, and `trophic_level`.
- [`centrality_reaching_local()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_reaching_local.md)
  /
  [`reaching_global()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/reaching_global.md)
  — Local and global reaching centrality (Mones, Vicsek & Vicsek 2012).
  Bit-exact match against `networkx.local_reaching_centrality` across
  the directed unweighted, undirected unweighted, and weighted branches.
  Undirected unweighted LRC coincides with
  `igraph::harmonic_centrality(normalized = TRUE)` (documented).
  [`reaching_global()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/reaching_global.md)
  is a graph-level hierarchy statistic in \[0, 1\].

## cograph 1.8.2

### New Features

- [`plot_simplicial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_simplicial.md)
  now accepts `tna`, `netobject`, `net_hon`, and `net_hypa` objects
  directly — higher-order pathways are auto-built and visualized with
  proper state labels, no manual extraction needed. New parameters:
  `method` (`"hon"` / `"hypa"`), `max_pathways`, `ncol`. Dismantled mode
  uses `gridExtra` grid layout with scaled nodes
- [`print.cograph_network()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/print.cograph_network.md)
  now shows a structured summary: node/edge counts, density,
  reciprocity, weight range, and top-degree nodes — replacing the
  minimal R6 default output
- Added `mcml` S3 class with
  [`as_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/as_mcml.md)
  generic for type-safe handling of Markov Chain Multi-Level models —
  enables [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html),
  [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html), and method
  dispatch on MCML objects
- Added local `%||%` operator for R 4.1 compatibility (no longer
  requires R 4.4+)

### Breaking Changes

- MCML field names renamed for clarity: `$between` → `$macro`, `$within`
  → `$clusters`
- [`as_tna()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/as_tna.md) on MCML
  objects now returns a flat `group_tna` list instead of a nested
  structure

### Bug Fixes

- [`plot_mcml()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_mcml.md)
  now suppresses zero-weight edges instead of drawing invisible lines,
  and strips leading zeros from edge labels (`.32` instead of `0.32`)
- Self-loops in
  [`cluster_summary()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/cluster_summary.html)
  are now preserved in the macro diagonal, reflecting intra-cluster
  retention rates
- Sequence data is properly propagated through the full tna → macro →
  cluster pipeline, so downstream models can use bootstrap and
  permutation tests

  [`plot_transitions()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_transitions.md)
  for controlling the distance between flow labels and nodes
- Added bundle legend label controls: `bundle_legend_size`,
  `bundle_legend_color`, `bundle_legend_fontface`,
  `bundle_legend_position`
- Added per-function label controls (`label_size`, `label_color`,
  `label_fontface`, `label_hjust`) to
  [`plot_transitions()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_transitions.md),
  [`plot_trajectories()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_trajectories.md),
  and
  [`plot_alluvial()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_alluvial.md)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed spiky text halo artifacts in transition and heatmap plots by
  increasing circular offset directions from 8 to 16 (22.5° spacing for
  smooth outlines)

  differences
- Added qgraph argument translation in
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md): when
  plotting tna objects, qgraph-style parameters (`vsize`, `asize`,
  `edge.color`, `lty`, `shape`) are automatically mapped to cograph
  equivalents

#### Transition Plot Enhancements

- Added intermediate labels with `node_label_format` (e.g.,
  `"{state} (n={count})"`) for showing counts on transition plot nodes
- Added line bundling via `bundle_size` for aggregating individual
  trajectories into weighted summary lines in large datasets

- Gave each `centrality_*` wrapper its own focused help page

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed load and percolation centrality computation: the BFS assumed
  unit edge weights, causing infinite loops on weighted graphs; directed
  graphs now transpose correctly (matching sna convention); disconnected
  nodes no longer contribute spurious centrality
- Fixed self-loop and edge clipping in
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md) viewport
  calculation
- Fixed argument forwarding in splot dispatch for bootstrap/permutation
  objects — named parameters (minimum, threshold, layout, title) were
  consumed by
  [`splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.md)’s
  signature and silently dropped when dispatching
- Fixed overlapping flow value labels in multi-step alluvial plots
- Fixed alluvial label halo rendering producing spike artifacts (8 → 16
  offset directions)
- Fixed viridis palette direction in
  [`plot_heatmap()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/plot_heatmap.md)
  so high values get dark colors
- Fixed
  [`build_mcml()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_mcml.html)
  density method crash when weight vector had no names
- Fixed display label priority resolution (labels \> label \>
  identifier)
- Removed zero-value labels that appeared after rounding in transition
  plots

### Improvements

- Simplified splot dispatch: extracted `.collect_dispatch_args()` helper
  to replace 6 copy-paste dispatch blocks, using
  [`match.call()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.call.html) +
  [`mget()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/get.html) for reliable argument
  capture

## cograph 1.6.0

  laplacian, current-flow betweenness, current-flow closeness, voterank
- Added
  [`edge_betweenness()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/edge_centrality.md)

## cograph 1.5.1

### Breaking Changes (with backwards compatibility)

The following parameters have been renamed for consistency. The old
names still work but emit deprecation warnings:
