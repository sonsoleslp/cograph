- mode:

  For directed networks: "all", "in", or "out". Affects degree,
  strength, closeness, eccentricity, coreness, and harmonic centrality.

- normalized:

  Logical. Normalize values to 0-1 range by dividing by max. For
  closeness, this is passed directly to igraph (proper normalization).

- weighted:

  Logical. Use edge weights if available. Default TRUE.

- directed:

  Logical or NULL. If NULL (default), auto-detect from matrix symmetry.
  Set TRUE to force directed, FALSE to force undirected.

- loops:

  Logical. If TRUE (default), keep self-loops. Set to FALSE to remove
  them before calculation.

- simplify:

  How to combine multiple edges between the same node pair. Options:
  "sum" (default), "mean", "max", "min", or FALSE/"none" to keep
  multiple edges.

- digits:

  Integer or NULL. Round all numeric columns to this many decimal
  places. Default NULL (no rounding).

- sort_by:

  Character or NULL. Column name to sort results by (descending order).
  Default NULL (original node order).

- cutoff:

  Maximum path length to consider for betweenness and closeness. Default
  -1 (no limit). Set to a positive value for faster computation on large
  networks at the cost of accuracy.

- invert_weights:

  Logical or NULL. For path-based measures (betweenness, closeness,
  harmonic, eccentricity, kreach), should weights be inverted so that
  higher weights mean shorter paths? Default NULL which auto-detects:
  TRUE for tna objects (transition probabilities), FALSE otherwise
  (matching igraph/sna). Set explicitly to TRUE for strength/frequency
  weights (qgraph style) or FALSE for distance/cost weights.

- alpha:

  Numeric. Exponent for weight transformation when
  `invert_weights = TRUE`. Distance is computed as `1 / weight^alpha`.
  Default 1. Higher values increase the influence of weight differences
  on path lengths.

- damping:

  PageRank damping factor. Default 0.85. Must be between 0 and 1.

- personalized:

  Named numeric vector for personalized PageRank. Default NULL (standard
  PageRank). Values should sum to 1.

- transitivity_type:

  Type of transitivity to calculate: "local" (default), "global",
  "undirected", "localundirected", "barrat" (weighted), or "weighted".

- isolates:

  How to handle isolate nodes in transitivity calculation: "nan"
  (default) returns NaN, "zero" returns 0.

- lambda:

  Diffusion scaling factor for diffusion centrality. Default 1.

- k:

  Path length parameter for geodesic k-path centrality. Default 3.

- states:

  Named numeric vector of percolation states (0-1) for percolation
  centrality. Each value represents how "activated" or "infected" a node
  is. Default NULL (all nodes get state 1, equivalent to betweenness).

- decay_parameter:

  Numeric. Decay parameter for decay and generalized closeness
  centrality. Default 0.5. Must be between 0 and 1.

- dmnc_epsilon:

  Numeric. Epsilon exponent for DMNC (Density of Maximum Neighborhood
  Component). Default 1.7 as recommended by Lin et al. (2008).
  centiserve uses 1.67 (four-community assumption). Must be between 1
  and 2.

- membership:

  Integer vector of community assignments (one per node) for
  community-aware measures: participation, within_module_z, gateway.
  Default NULL. Required when requesting these measures.

- katz_alpha:

  Attenuation factor for Katz centrality. Must satisfy \\\alpha \< 1 /
  \rho(A)\\. Default 0.1 (matches centiserve and NetworkX conventions).
  Only used when `"katz"` is in `measures`.

- hubbell_weight:

  Weight factor \\w\\ for Hubbell centrality. Must satisfy \\w \cdot
  \rho(W) \le 1\\ for solvability. Default 0.5. Only used when
  `"hubbell"` is in `measures`.

- ...:

  Additional arguments (currently unused)
