## Arguments

- x:

  Network input (matrix, edge-list data frame, igraph, network,
  cograph_network, tna object)

- type:

  Character scalar selecting a curated tier of measures when `measures`
  is not supplied. One of:

  `"basic"`

  :   (default) 6 canonical measures: `degree`, `strength`, `closeness`,
      `betweenness`, `eigenvector`, `pagerank`.

  `"extended"`

  :   Basic plus commonly-reported second-tier measures: harmonic,
      coreness, eccentricity, radiality, lin, decay, load, stress, katz,
      alpha, power, authority, leverage, constraint, effective_size,
      bridging, transitivity, subgraph, diffusion, laplacian, kreach,
      current_flow_betweenness, current_flow_closeness.

  `"all"`

  :   Every measure except the costly ones, which are held back (see
      `include` and
      [`list_centralities`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/list_centralities.md)).

  Passing `measures` explicitly overrides `type`.

- measures:

  Character vector of specific measure names to compute. When `NULL`
  (default) the tier selected by `type` is used. Accepts `"all"` as a
  shortcut for `type = "all"`, i.e. every measure except the costly
  ones. Any custom vector of valid measure names is also accepted, and
  naming a costly measure there always computes it. **Core**
  (igraph-backed): "degree", "strength", "betweenness", "closeness",
  "eigenvector", "pagerank", "authority", "hub", "eccentricity",
  "coreness", "constraint", "transitivity", "harmonic", "alpha",
  "power", "subgraph". **Native**: "diffusion", "leverage", "kreach",
  "laplacian", "load", "current_flow_closeness",
  "current_flow_betweenness", "voterank", "percolation".
  **Distance-based**: "radiality", "lin", "decay", "residual_closeness",
  "dangalchev", "generalized_closeness", "harary", "average_distance",
  "barycenter", "wiener", "closeness_vitality". **Spectral/walk**:
  "communicability", "communicability_betweenness", "random_walk".
  **Path-based**: "stress", "flow_betweenness". **Local/neighborhood**:
  "lobby", "entropy", "semilocal", "clusterrank", "bottleneck",
  "centroid", "mnc", "dmnc", "lac", "topological_coefficient",
  "bridging", "local_bridging", "effective_size", "diversity",
  "cross_clique", "markov". **Influence**: "integration", "expected",
  "gilschmidt". **Directed-only**: "salsa", "leaderrank",
  "trophic_level", "pairwisedis", "prestige_domain",
  "prestige_domain_proximity". **Community-aware** (require
  `membership`): "participation", "within_module_z", "gateway",
  "brokerage_coordinator", "brokerage_itinerant",
  "brokerage_representative", "brokerage_gatekeeper",
  "brokerage_liaison" (the last 5 also require a directed graph; see
  [`centrality_brokerage_coordinator`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_brokerage_coordinator.md)).
  **Zoo (batch 2)**: "gravity", "collective_influence", "local_hindex",
  "hindex_strength", "onion", "second_order", "infection",
  "nonbacktracking", "spanning_tree". **Classical (batch 3,
  reference-validated)**: "katz" (Katz 1953), "hubbell" (Hubbell 1965),
  "information" (Stephenson-Zelen 1989), "reaching_local" (Mones et al.
  2012). See
  [`centrality_katz`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_katz.md),

  [`centrality_information`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_information.md),
  [`centrality_pairwisedis`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_pairwisedis.md),
  [`centrality_reaching_local`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_reaching_local.md).
  **Psychometric (signed-weight)**: "expected_influence_1",
  "expected_influence_2" (Robinaugh, Millner & McNally 2016). Expected
  influence keeps signed edge contributions, which is important when
  edges can be negative (partial-correlation, glasso, signed correlation
  networks). **Zoo (batch 7, lowest rank-redundancy with the rest of the
  package per the Centrality Zoo comparison)**: "distance_entropy"
  (Stella & De Domenico 2018), "local_dimension" (Pu et al. 2014),
  "local_information_dimension" (Wen & Deng 2020),
  "neighborhood_connectivity" (Maslov & Sneppen 2002), and
  "modularity_vitality" (Magelinski et al. 2021; requires `membership`).
  The first three are hop-count measures and ignore edge weights. See
  [`centrality_distance_entropy`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_distance_entropy.md),
  [`centrality_local_dimension`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_dimension.md),

  [`centrality_modularity_vitality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_modularity_vitality.md).
  **Zoo (batch 8, the measures the Zoo comparison left "on the way")**:
  "shapley_game1", "shapley_game2", "shapley_game3" (Michalak et al.
  2013), "access_information", "hide_information" (Rosvall et al. 2005),
  "rumor" (Shah & Zaman 2011), "community_hub_bridge" (Ghalmane et al.
  2019; requires `membership`), "entropy_variation_degree",
  "entropy_variation_betweenness" (Ai 2017), "s_shell" (Liu et al.
  2017), "degree_discount", "single_discount" (Chen, Wang & Yang 2009),
  "ncvoterank" (Kumar & Panda 2020). All are hop-count or topology-only
  measures; edge weights are ignored. See the per-measure pages, e.g.
  [`centrality_shapley_game1`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_shapley_game1.md),
  [`centrality_access_information`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_access_information.md),

  [`centrality_ncvoterank`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ncvoterank.md).
  **Zoo (batch 9, the remaining measures with a pinned definition)**:
  community-aware "community_based" (Zhao et al. 2015),
  "comm_centrality" (Gupta et al. 2016), "community_mediator" (Tulu et
  al. 2018), all requiring `membership`; dimension family
  "local_dimension_fixed" (Silva & Costa 2013), "fuzzy_local_dimension"
  (Wen & Jiang 2019), "local_volume_dimension" (Li & Deng 2021);
  VoteRank family "wvoterank" (Sun et al. 2019), "enrenew" (Guo et al.
  2020), "voterank_plus" (Liu et al. 2021); "node_contraction",
  "node_contraction_improved" (Tan et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2011);
  "two_way_rw" (Curado et al. 2022); local measures "heatmap" (Duron
  2020), "flow_coefficient" (Honey et al. 2007), "local_entropy" (Nie et
  al. 2016), "weighted_h_index" (Gao et al. 2019), "redundancy" (Burt
  1992); "weighted_kshell" (Garas et al. 2012), "renewed_coreness" (Liu
  et al. 2015), "geodesic_kpath" (Borgatti & Everett 2006). Only
  "wvoterank", "two_way_rw" and "weighted_kshell" use edge weights. See
  [`centrality_community_based`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_community_based.md),
  [`centrality_local_dimension_fixed`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_dimension_fixed.md),

  [`centrality_heatmap`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_heatmap.md),
  [`centrality_weighted_kshell`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_weighted_kshell.md).

  Batch 10 closes the gaps other centrality packages had and cograph did
  not: "local_efficiency" (Latora & Marchiori 2001), "s_core" (Eidsaa &
  Almaas 2013), "fragmentation" (Borgatti 2006), "kpath" (Sade 1989) and
  "epc" (Lin et al. 2008). "fragmentation" and "epc" are costly, so
  `type = "all"` holds them back. See
  [`centrality_local_efficiency`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_local_efficiency.md).

  Batch 11 tunes families cograph already had:
  "length_scaled_betweenness" (Brandes 2008), "delta_betweenness" and
  "delta_closeness" (Agneessens et al. 2017), "ego_betweenness" (Everett
  & Borgatti 2005). "gravity" gained `gravity_mass` and
  `gravity_radius`, and its formula was corrected – see
  [`centrality_gravity`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_gravity.md).
  Bounded-distance ("k-") betweenness needs no measure of its own: it is
  `cutoff = k`. See
  [`centrality_length_scaled_betweenness`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_length_scaled_betweenness.md).

- include:

  Character vector of costly measures to add back to a tier, or
  `"costly"` for all of them. `type = "all"` holds back the measures
  whose cost grows steeply with network size (see
  [`list_centralities`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/list_centralities.md)),
  so that one call cannot take minutes by accident. Naming a measure in
  `measures` always computes it, whatever its cost. Default `NULL`.

- mode:

  For directed networks: "all", "in", or "out". Affects measures whose
  output columns carry a mode suffix, including degree, strength,
  closeness, eccentricity, coreness, harmonic, diffusion, leverage,
  k-reach, distance-based measures, community-aware measures, and
  expected influence.

- normalized:

  Logical. Normalize values by dividing by max. Most measures are scaled
  to 0-1; signed expected-influence measures can retain negative values
  under psychometric normalization. For closeness, this is passed
  directly to igraph.

- weighted:

  Logical. Use edge weights if available. Default TRUE.

- directed:

  Logical or NULL. If NULL (default), auto-detect from matrix symmetry.
  Set TRUE to force directed, FALSE to force undirected.

- loops:

  Logical. If TRUE (default), keep self-loops. Set to FALSE to remove
  them before calculation.

- simplify:

  How to combine multiple edges between the same node pair (possible
  only from edge-list, cograph_network or igraph input). Options: "sum"
  (default), "mean", "max", "min". `FALSE` and `"none"` also sum them:
  the network is held as a dense weight matrix, which cannot carry
  parallel edges.

- digits:

  Integer or NULL. Round all numeric columns to this many decimal
  places. Default NULL (no rounding).

- sort_by:

  Character or NULL. Column name to sort results by (descending order).
  Default NULL (original node order).

- cutoff:

  Maximum path length to consider for betweenness, closeness, harmonic
  centrality and the distance-based closeness variants (radiality, lin,
  decay, residual_closeness, dangalchev, generalized_closeness, harary,
  average_distance, barycenter, wiener, centroid, closeness_vitality,
  delta_closeness). Default -1 (no limit). Set to a positive value for
  faster computation on large networks at the cost of accuracy.

- invert_weights:

  Logical or NULL. For path- and distance-based measures (for example
  betweenness, closeness, harmonic, eccentricity, k-reach, radiality,
  decay, stress, flow betweenness, and related variants), should weights
  be inverted so that higher weights mean shorter paths? Default NULL
  auto-detects: TRUE for tna objects (transition probabilities), FALSE
  otherwise (matching igraph/sna). Set explicitly to TRUE for
  strength/frequency weights (qgraph style) or FALSE for distance/cost
  weights.

- alpha:

  Numeric. Exponent for weight transformation when
  `invert_weights = TRUE`. Distance is computed as `1 / weight^alpha`.
  Default 1. Higher values increase the influence of weight differences
  on path lengths.

- damping:

  PageRank damping factor. Default 0.85. Must be between 0 and 1.

- personalized:

  Named numeric vector for personalized PageRank. Default NULL (standard
  PageRank). Values should sum to 1.

- transitivity_type:

  Type of transitivity to calculate: "local" (default), "global",
  "undirected", "localundirected", "barrat" (weighted), "weighted", or
  "onnela". The first six dispatch to
  [`igraph::transitivity()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/transitivity.html);
  `"onnela"` computes the Onnela / Holme weighted clustering coefficient
  on the symmetrized matrix (`wcc(x + t(x))`) and matches
  `tna::centralities(., "Clustering")` byte-for-byte. Auto-set to
  `"onnela"` when `tna_network = TRUE` and the user did not pass an
  explicit value.

- isolates:

  How to handle isolate nodes in transitivity calculation: "nan"
  (default) returns NaN, "zero" returns 0.

- lambda:

  Diffusion scaling factor for diffusion centrality. Default 1. Only
  used when `diffusion_method = "kandhway_kuri"`.

- diffusion_method:

  Character or NULL. Selects the diffusion-centrality formula.
  `"kandhway_kuri"` (Kandhway & Kuri, 2014) computes the 1-hop
  binary-degree neighborhood sum \\\lambda d_v + \lambda \sum\_{u \in
  N(v)} d_u\\. `"power_series"` computes the matrix power series
  \\\mathrm{rowSums}(P + P^2 + \ldots + P^n)\\ on the (optionally
  diagonal-zeroed) weighted matrix and matches
  `tna::centralities(., measures = "Diffusion")` when `loops = FALSE`.
  Default NULL auto-detects: `"power_series"` for tna objects
  (transition probabilities), `"kandhway_kuri"` otherwise.

- k:

  Path length parameter for geodesic k-path centrality. Default 3.

- states:

  Named numeric vector of percolation states (0-1) for percolation
  centrality. Each value represents how "activated" or "infected" a node
  is. Default NULL (all nodes get state 1, equivalent to betweenness).

- decay_parameter:

  Numeric. Decay parameter for decay and generalized closeness
  centrality. Default 0.5. Must be between 0 and 1.

- dmnc_epsilon:

  Numeric. Epsilon exponent for DMNC (Density of Maximum Neighborhood
  Component). Default 1.7 as recommended by Lin et al. (2008).
  centiserve uses 1.67 (four-community assumption). Must be between 1
  and 2.

- membership:

  Integer vector of community assignments (one per node) for
  community-aware measures: participation, within_module_z, gateway,
  modularity_vitality, and the Gould-Fernandez brokerage roles. Default
  NULL. Required when requesting these measures.

- katz_alpha:

  Attenuation factor for Katz centrality. Must satisfy \\\alpha \< 1 /
  \rho(A)\\. Default 0.1 (matches centiserve and NetworkX conventions).
  Only used when `"katz"` is in `measures`.

- hubbell_weight:

  Weight factor \\w\\ for Hubbell centrality. Must be positive and
  satisfy \\w \cdot \rho(W) \< 1\\ for solvability; otherwise the
  measure warns and returns `NA`. Default 0.5. Only used when
  `"hubbell"` is in `measures`.

- shapley_k:

  Neighbor threshold \\k\\ for `"shapley_game2"`. Default 2. See
  [`centrality_shapley_game2`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_shapley_game1.md).

- shapley_cutoff:

  Hop cutoff for `"shapley_game3"`. Default 2. See
  [`centrality_shapley_game3`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_shapley_game1.md).

- s_shell_a:

  Exponent of the asymmetric link weights for `"s_shell"`. A single
  non-negative number; default 0.5. See
  [`centrality_s_shell`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_s_shell.md).

- discount_p:

  Propagation probability for `"degree_discount"`. Default 0.01. See
  [`centrality_degree_discount`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_degree_discount.md).

  [`centrality_ncvoterank`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ncvoterank.md).

- comm_r:

  Scale \\R\\ of `"comm_centrality"`: `"max_intra"` (default) or a
  single positive number.

- ld_radius:

  Radius for `"local_dimension_fixed"`, in hops. A single number of at
  least 1; default 2.

- enrenew_depth:

  Renewal radius for `"enrenew"`. Default 2.

- voterank_lambda:

  Suppression factor for `"voterank_plus"`. Default 0.1.

- contraction_rho:

  \\\alpha / \beta\\ for `"node_contraction_improved"`. Default 5.

- wks_alpha, wks_beta:

  Degree and strength exponents for `"weighted_kshell"`. Default 1 and
  1.

- renewed_threshold:

  Diffusion-importance threshold for `"renewed_coreness"`. Default 2.

- kpath_k:

  Maximum path length for `"geodesic_kpath"`. Default 3.

- kpath_len:

  Maximum path length for `"kpath"`. Default 3; the enumeration is
  exhaustive, so cost grows with the branching factor to this power.

- epc_threshold:

  Edge removal probability for `"epc"`. Default 0.5.

- epc_runs:

  Number of percolation realizations for `"epc"`. Default 1000.

- epc_seed:

  Random seed for `"epc"`. Default `NULL`, which leaves the caller's
  stream alone and lets the estimate vary between calls.

- betweenness_delta:

  Decay exponent for `"delta_betweenness"`. Default 1; 0 gives ordinary
  betweenness.

- closeness_delta:

  Distance exponent for `"delta_closeness"`. Default 1, which is
  `harmonic` over \\n - 1\\.

  (Li et al. 2019) or `"legacy"` for cograph's pre-2.4.8 form.

- gravity_radius:

  Largest distance each gravity source reaches in `"gravity"`,
  `"extended_gravity"`, `"mixed_gravity"` or `"extended_mixed_gravity"`:
  a number (default 3), `"auto"` for half the mean distance, or `NULL`
  for the whole graph. The auto radius uses finite positive distances,
  rounds to the nearest integer (ties to even), and has minimum 1; these
  are cograph conventions.

- mdd_lambda:

  Exhausted-degree weight for `"mdd"`, between 0 and 1. Default 0.7. See

  Nonnegative integer horizon for `"diffusion_centrality"`, default 3.
  See

  [`centrality_map_equation`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_map_equation.md).

- sr_prior:

  SpectralRank diagonal prior, default zero; scalar or one value per
  node. See
  [`centrality_spectralrank`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_spectralrank.md).

- mcgm_radius:

  MCGM hop cutoff, default two; NULL includes all reachable nodes.

- mcgm_alpha:

  MCGM coefficient, NULL for the published adaptive rule. See
  [`centrality_mcgm`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_mcgm.md)
  for disconnected-graph conventions.

- dkgm_radius:

  DKGM hop cutoff, default two as in the paper's printed example; NULL
  or infinity includes all reachable nodes and "auto" applies the
  paper's half-mean-distance rule with cograph rounding. See
  [`centrality_dkgm`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_dkgm.md).

- nd_order:

  Steps of neighbors summed by `"neighbor_distance"`, a nonnegative
  whole number, default two; zero returns `nd_mass`. See
  [`centrality_neighbor_distance`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_neighbor_distance.md).

- nd_decay:

  Per-step decay for `"neighbor_distance"`, a finite number, default 0.2
  as in the source.

- nd_mass:

  Benchmark centrality summed by `"neighbor_distance"`: degree (default)
  or coreness.

- ira_mass:

  Node centrality allocated by `"ira"` and `"iira"`: coreness (default,
  the k-shell index both sources use in their worked examples) or
  degree. See
  [`centrality_ira`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ira.md).

- ira_alpha:

  Exponent on the `"ira"` mass, a finite number, default one as in the
  source.

- ira_tol:

  Stopping tolerance for `"ira"` on the largest absolute change between
  iterates, a positive finite number, default `1e-6` as in the source.

- ira_max_iter:

  Iteration bound for `"ira"`, a whole number of at least one,
  default 1000. Reaching it raises `cograph_no_converge`, which a
  bipartite component with unequal vertex classes always does. See
  [`centrality_ira`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_ira.md).

- iira_beta:

  Spreading rate for `"iira"`, a number in \\(0,1\]\\, default 0.2 as in
  the source.

- iira_steps:

  Iterations for `"iira"`, a nonnegative whole number, default 50 as in

- hcc_delta:

  Weight on a node's own degree in the extended degree used by `"hcc"`
  and `"ehcc"`, a single number in \\\[0,1\]\\, default 0.5 as in the
  source; one recovers the classical degree and zero drops the node's
  own degree entirely. Values outside \\\[0,1\]\\ are refused. See
  [`centrality_hcc`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_hcc.md).

- lhc_radius:

  Radius of the ball \\\Phi(v)\\ summed over by `"lhc"`, the \\d\\ of
  the source's equation (1); a single whole number of at least one,
  default 2 as the source sets it. The source sweeps it and reports 2-3
  as optimal. At one the ball collapses to the neighbors; at or above
  the diameter the score stops moving. Values below one and non-integers
  are refused. See
  [`centrality_lhc`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_lhc.md).

- tpr_alpha:

  Jump probability of the trust-PageRank iteration used by
  `"trust_pagerank"`, a single number strictly between zero and one,
  default 0.85 as the source sets it below its equation (7). See
  [`centrality_trust_pagerank`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_trust_pagerank.md).

- tpr_k:

  Weight the trust-value puts on the degree ratio rather than the
  similarity ratio in `"trust_pagerank"`, the \\k\\ of the source's
  equation (6); a single number in \\\[0,1\]\\, default 0.85, the value
  the source's section 3.3 selects from a Kendall-against-SIR sweep. One
  drops the similarity entirely and zero drops the degree.

- tpr_decay:

  Attenuation factor of the similarity recursion used by
  `"trust_pagerank"`, the \\C\\ of the source's equation (4); a single
  number in \\(0,1\]\\, default 1 as the source fixes it. The source's
  claim that \\C\\ does not affect the result holds only for a
  homogeneous recursion and not for this one; see
  [`centrality_trust_pagerank`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_trust_pagerank.md).

- tpr_tol:

  Convergence tolerance on the largest *relative* change of either
  trust-PageRank recursion, a single positive number, default `1e-14`.
  The source fixes no iteration count because it does not need one: both
  recursions have unique fixed points. The test is relative rather than
  absolute because the similarities on one graph span many orders of
  magnitude; see
  [`centrality_trust_pagerank`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_trust_pagerank.md).

- tpr_max_iter:

  Iteration bound for both trust-PageRank recursions, a whole number of
  at least one, default 1000. Reaching it raises `cograph_no_converge`.

- rsp_beta:

  Inverse temperature of the randomized-shortest-paths model used by
  `"rsp_betweenness"`, a single finite number strictly above zero,
  default 0.01. The source fixes no default; 0.01 is the value
  `NetworkToolbox::rspbc()` recommends, and it sits near the random-walk
  limit, so raise it towards 1 and beyond to move the reading towards
  shortest paths. See
  [`centrality_rsp_betweenness`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_rsp_betweenness.md).

- rsp_cost:

  How an edge weight becomes a traversal cost for `"rsp_betweenness"`:
  `"inverse"` (default) for \\C=1/w\\, reading a weight as an affinity,
  or `"weight"` for \\C=w\\, reading it as a distance. The source leaves
  the cost matrix free; both settings give unit cost per arc on a binary
  graph. See
  [`centrality_rsp_betweenness`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_rsp_betweenness.md).

- re_indexes:

  Constituent indexes integrated by `"relative_entropy"`, default the
  source's four distinctiveness indexes; the vocabulary also holds
  `"n_components"` and `"largest_component"`. See
  [`centrality_relative_entropy`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_relative_entropy.md).

- re_negative:

  Which of `re_indexes` are negative indexes, NULL for the source's own
  declarations. See
  [`centrality_relative_entropy`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_relative_entropy.md).

- tna_network:

  Logical or NULL. Umbrella switch that forces tna-style conventions
  across all measures. `NULL` (default) auto-detects from the input
  class — TRUE iff `x` is a `tna` or related sequence-network object.
  `TRUE` forces tna conventions even on raw matrices:
  `invert_weights = TRUE`, `loops = FALSE`,
  `diffusion_method = "power_series"`, `transitivity_type = "onnela"`.
  `FALSE` suppresses all tna defaults even for tna inputs, giving the
  cograph defaults verbatim. Precedence: any arg the user passes
  explicitly always wins over `tna_network`.

- psych_network:

  Logical or NULL. Switch for signed psychometric network conventions.
  `NULL` (default) auto-detects TRUE when a signed weighted network is
  evaluated with expected-influence measures. When `TRUE`, normalized
  expected influence is divided by the maximum absolute
  expected-influence value, preserving sign and bounding the result from
  -1 to 1. `FALSE` keeps the generic cograph normalization convention.

- ...:

  Additional arguments (currently unused)

## Value

A base `data.frame` with one row per node, in the input's node order
unless `sort_by` is given, and the columns:

- `node`: character, the node labels (the index as a string when the
  input carried no names)

- One numeric column per requested measure, with a mode suffix for the
  mode-aware measures (e.g., `degree_in`, `closeness_all`); see
  [`list_centralities`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/list_centralities.md)
  for which measures carry a suffix. A measure that a tier supplied but
  that has no value on this input is an all-`NA` column.

  Exponential focal degree with partner degrees discounted by a global
  mean-degree distance exponent (IGSM).

- weighted_leaderrank:

  Stationary scores with ground-node outgoing weights determined by
  original in-degree and `wlr_alpha`.

- linerank:

  PageRank on the line graph, aggregated at endpoints; uses `damping`
  and `linerank_aggregation`.

- expected_force:

  Entropy of onward boundary degrees over all two-event transmission
  sequences.

- mcgm:

  Multi-characteristics gravity with degree, coreness and eigenvector
  masses; default radius two.

- spectralrank:

  Outgoing Perron eigenvector with a unit-linked ground node; `sr_prior`
  supplies optional diagonal information.

- controlrank:

  Smallest eigenvalue of each grounded symmetric row-Laplacian; see
  [`centrality_controlrank`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_controlrank.md).

- map_equation:

  Codelength saving on silencing a node, conditional on the supplied
  partition, flow model and coding convention.

- ninl:

  Finite neighbor propagation of closed-neighborhood degree volume; uses
  `ninl_order` and `ninl_radius`.

- beta_measure:

  BG power shared by successors among predecessors; `beta_direction`
  selects positive or negative orientation.

- localized_bridging, extended_local_bridging:

  Betweenness in one-hop or two-hop ego networks times the original
  bridging coefficient.

- modified_expected_force:

  Expected Force multiplied by log degree with the scaling parameter
  `exf_alpha`.

- proximal_betweenness:

  First/last shortest-path intermediaries; uses `proximal_variant` on
  the directed unweighted skeleton.

- x_degree:

  Counts four-edge nonbacktracking walks with each node at the middle,
  using original neighbor excess degrees.

- coleman_theil:

  Concentration of dyadic Burt constraints across contacts; isolates
  zero and single-contact nodes one.

- bridging_capital:

  Information-walk loss under single-entry deletion; uses
  `bridging_steps` and `bridging_values`.

- random_walk_decay:

  Weighted sum of discounted first arrivals from random walks; uses
  `rwd_decay` and `rwd_node_weights`.

- graph_regularization:

  Reciprocal diagonal of the inverse regularized weighted Laplacian,
  using `grc_gamma`.

- adaptive_leaderrank:

  Stationary scores with destination weights determined by original
  H-indices using `alr_h_mode`.

## Measures without a value on a given input

A few measures are undefined on some graphs – the community-partition
measures without `membership`, or `"relative_entropy"` when one of its
constituent indexes is zero at every node. Naming such a measure in
`measures` or `include` raises a classed condition, because you asked
for that measure. When a tier (`type = "basic"`, `"extended"` or
`"all"`) supplied it, the condition becomes a
`cograph_undefined_measure` warning and the column is `NA`, so one
undefined measure does not take the rest of the tier with it.
