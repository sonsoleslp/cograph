# Finite-horizon diffusion centrality

Banerjee et al.'s diffusion centrality is \\DC(A;q,T) =
\sum\_{t=1}^{T}(qA)^t\mathbf{1}\\. It sums weighted walks starting at
each node, allowing revisits and returns to the source. Directed edges
carry information from their source to their target: the result uses row
sums, regardless of `mode`. Transpose the input adjacency matrix to
measure incoming walks.

## Usage

``` r
centrality_diffusion_centrality(x, diffusion_q = 1, diffusion_steps = 3, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input accepted by
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).

- diffusion_q:

  Finite multiplier between 0 and 1, default 1.

- diffusion_steps:

  Nonnegative integer horizon, default 3. Must be no larger than
  `.Machine$integer.max`.

- ...:

  Additional arguments to
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).
  With `normalized = TRUE`, positive scores are divided by their
  maximum.

## Value

Named numeric vector in input node order.

## Details

A is the adjacency matrix with the original edge weights when
`weighted = TRUE`, or unit edge weights otherwise. Self-loops follow
`loops`; an undirected self-loop contributes its weight once on the
diagonal. The `simplify` argument combines parallel edges first; any
remaining parallel edges contribute additively to A. Weight inversion
for shortest paths does not affect this measure.

When every entry of qA is between zero and one, scores have the paper's
interpretation as expected total hearings of information. Larger weights
are accepted as a mathematical weighted-walk extension of that
polynomial, without a probability interpretation. Scores count repeated
hearings, not distinct recipients. They need not be bounded by the
number of nodes.

Default q = 1 and T = 3 are explicit cograph choices, not estimates of a
diffusion process or the parameters used by the Zoo. T = 0 returns zero;
T = 1 gives q times outgoing strength (degree for a binary graph). A
finite horizon requires no spectral convergence condition. Numerical
overflow raises an error, including when normalization is requested.

This is distinct from
[`centrality_diffusion`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_diffusion.md):
its default is diffusion degree, and its TNA variant fixes q = 1 and T =
n. The existing `lambda` and `diffusion_method` arguments do not affect
this measure. Computation uses T matrix-vector products.
