# DK-based gravity model

The DK-based gravity model (DKGM) puts the degree k-shell index of both
ends into a truncated squared-distance gravity sum: \\DKGM_i=\sum\_{j\ne
i,\\d(i,j)\le R}DK(i)DK(j)/d(i,j)^2\\. The mass \\DK(i)=k(i)+k_s^\*(i)\\
adds the degree to an improved shell index
\\k_s^\*(i)=k_s(i)+p(i)/(\max_k q(k)+1)\\, where \\p(i)\\ is the removal
stage inside the node's shell and \\q(k)\\ the number of stages the
k-level needed. The stage breaks the ties that degree and k-shell leave
behind: two nodes of the same shell are separated by how late the
peeling reached them.

## Usage

``` r
centrality_dkgm(x, dkgm_radius = 2, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input accepted by
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).

- dkgm_radius:

  Nonnegative hop-distance cutoff, default two, the value used for the
  paper's Table 5 and one of the two the paper recommends in general.
  `NULL` or infinity includes every reachable partner. Fractional
  cutoffs include exactly the integer hop distances not exceeding them;
  values below one give zero. `"auto"` applies the paper's own equation
  4, \\R^\*\approx\langle d\rangle/2\\, with cograph conventions: half
  the mean finite positive hop distance, rounded to the nearest integer
  with ties to even, minimum one. Those conventions and the treatment of
  disconnected graphs are cograph's, not the paper's.

## Value

Named numeric vector in input node order.

## Details

Stages restart at one inside every shell, but the denominator \\\max_k
q(k)+1\\ is a single global maximum. A node's mass therefore depends on
the whole graph: adding a disconnected component that peels in more
stages lengthens that denominator and changes every raw score. This is a
property of the published definition, not a cograph choice, and it
distinguishes DKGM from
[`centrality_mixed_gravity`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_mixed_gravity.md).

The paper's Algorithm 1 says "Find all nodes in G with degree k" while
its stage loop ends "until All remaining nodes in G have degree \> k"
and its Methods define k-shell by removing "nodes whose degree k \<= 1
... Until there are no nodes in the network with degree k \<= 1". Strict
equality cannot terminate on a three-node path, so cograph follows the
at-most reading, which is the only one consistent with the printed
termination condition and which reproduces the paper's Tables 2 to 5.
Removal inside a stage is simultaneous, matching the printed two-stage
two-shell. Because the level starts at one, an isolate falls in the
one-shell rather than the zero-shell `centrality(measures = "coreness")`
reports; isolates carry no edges, so no other node's shell, stage or
score is affected.

Uses the simple undirected unweighted skeleton, which is the source
domain: either arc creates one edge, parallel edges count once and loops
are removed. This projection is a cograph convention outside that
domain. Edge weights, mode, cutoff, gravity_mass and path-weight
inversion are ignored. Unreachable partners contribute nothing. Isolates
and singleton graphs score zero; empty graphs return no scores. Optional
maximum normalization applies to the complete result over all nodes.
Dense all-pairs distances cost O(n cubed) time and O(n squared) memory.

Numerical verification establishes agreement with the published
equations and the printed nine-node example, not parity with author
software, which was not located, nor any claim about spreading
performance.
