# Heatmap, Flow Coefficient, Local Entropy, Weighted h-index, Redundancy

Five local measures.

## Usage

``` r
centrality_heatmap(x, mode = "all", ...)

centrality_flow_coefficient(x, ...)

centrality_local_entropy(x, mode = "all", ...)

centrality_weighted_h_index(x, mode = "all", ...)

centrality_redundancy(x, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input (matrix, igraph, network, cograph_network, tna object).

- mode:

  For directed networks: `"all"` (default), `"out"` (distances along
  out-edges), or `"in"`.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).

## Value

Named numeric vector, one value per node.

## Details

- `heatmap` (Duron 2020):

  Farness minus the mean farness of the neighbors, \\C(v) = f(v) -
  \frac{1}{k_v} \sum\_{u \in N(v)} f(u)\\, with \\f\\ the sum of hop
  distances to reachable nodes. **Lower is more central.** Isolates
  score `NaN`. Reproduces Table 1 of the paper.

- `flow_coefficient` (Honey et al. 2007):

  Among ordered pairs of distinct neighbors, the fraction joined by a
  two-step path through the node but not by a direct link, as
  implemented in the Brain Connectivity Toolbox. On an undirected graph
  it equals one minus the clustering coefficient; it carries new
  information only on directed graphs. Nodes with fewer than two
  neighbors score 0.

- `local_entropy` (Nie et al. 2016):

  \\-\sum\_{j \in N(i)} k_j \ln k_j\\, as printed by the sources. Always
  non-positive and more negative for larger, denser neighborhoods, so
  **lower is more central**; isolates score 0, the maximum. The original
  article is closed access; the formula is that of the Zoo and of Omar
  and Plapper's 2021 survey, which agree.

- `weighted_h_index` (Gao et al. 2019):

  h-index of the multiset in which each neighbor \\j\\ contributes the
  topological weight \\k_i k_j\\ repeated \\k_j\\ times. Edge weights on
  the input play no role.

- `redundancy` (Burt 1992; Borgatti 1997):

  Mean degree of the node's neighbors within its ego network, \\2 t_i /
  k_i\\; equal to degree minus effective size. Higher = fewer structural
  holes. Reproduces Borgatti's worked example.

`heatmap`, `local_entropy` and `weighted_h_index` follow `mode`; the
others ignore direction. Edge weights are ignored.
