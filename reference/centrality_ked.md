# KED method centrality

The KED method of Chen, Xiao, Zeng and Zhang combines how many local
paths leave a node with how diverse they are:
\\KED(i)=k_i\\(1+H_i)\\\exp(K_i/N)\\, where \\K_i=\sum\_{j\in N(i)}k_j\\
is the sum of the neighbors' degrees, \\H_i=\bigl(\sum\_{j\in
N(i)}-p_j\log p_j\bigr)/\log k_i\\ with \\p_j=k_j/K_i\\ is the
normalized entropy of the neighbor-degree distribution, and \\N\\ is the
number of nodes in the whole graph. The source calls \\K_i\\ the local
path number and \\H_i\\ the path diversity: two nodes of equal degree
with equally many second neighbors are separated by how evenly their
neighbors carry those paths.

## Value

Named numeric vector in input node order.

## Details

\\H_i\\ is a ratio of two logarithms in the same base – equation (2)
divides the entropy by the entropy of the uniform distribution on
\\k_i\\ outcomes – so the base cancels and no choice of base is being
made. \\H_i\\ lies in \\\[0,1\]\\ and is exactly one when the neighbor
degrees are all equal, which is the source's \\1\le E_i\le 2\\.

The measure takes no parameters. Equation (6) is a bare product; the
exponents \\\alpha\\ and \\\beta\\ the Centrality Zoo attributes to Chen
et al. appear nowhere in the paper, and none is offered here.

**Two degenerate cases are cograph decisions, not the source's.** A node
with one neighbor has \\p=1\\, so its entropy is zero, and its
normalizer \\\log k_i\\ is zero too: \\H_i\\ is \\0/0\\ and is written
as **zero**, giving \\E_i=1\\. That is the value approached from
\\k_i=2\\ as one neighbor's share vanishes, and the one that gives a
node with a single path the least path diversity; the alternative
reading of \\0/0\\ as "the entropy equals its own maximum, so \\H=1\\"
would double every leaf's score. An isolate has both sums empty; \\H_i\\
is written as zero there as well, and the score is zero whatever finite
\\E_i\\ is chosen, because \\k_i\\ multiplies the product. Empty graphs
return no scores.

**Raw scores are not comparable across graphs of different order.**
\\N\\ in \\D_i\\ is the vertex count of the whole network, as the
source's own table 1 defines it, so adding a disconnected component – an
isolate included – changes every score, and unlike a plain rescaling it
can also change the ranking, because \\\exp(K_i/N)\\ shrinks the large
\\K_i\\ more than the small.

**The source's stated range \\1\le D_i\le e\\ is not general.** It holds
exactly when \\K_i\le N\\, which is true of the sparse toy networks of
its figure 1 and false on dense graphs: every node of \\K_5\\ has
\\K_i=16\\ against \\N=5\\, so \\D_i=e^{3.2}\\. cograph implements the
formula, not the range claim. Scores can therefore be large; \\K_i/N\le
(n-1)^2/n\\, so nothing overflows below about 710 vertices even on a
complete graph, and an overflow beyond that raises an error rather than
returning `Inf`.

**This is not the Centrality Zoo's formula.** Zoo section 2.215 writes
\\c\_{KED}(i)=k_i E_i^\alpha D_i^\beta\\ with
\\E_i=\bigl(\sum\_{j}-p_j\log p_j\bigr)/\log k_i\\ and
\\D_i=\exp(K_i/\max_l K_l)\\: it drops the \\1+\\ from \\E_i\\ and
divides by the largest cluster degree instead of by \\N\\. On the
source's own figure 1 that reading gives 13.5914 and 6.5672 where the
paper prints 25.9187 and 19.2212, which cograph reproduces. The \\\max_l
K_l\\ denominator is a plausible misreading, since it makes the paper's
stated \\1\le D_i\le e\\ hold, but it reproduces neither printed number.
cograph implements the paper and offers no Zoo variant.

Uses the simple undirected unweighted skeleton, the source's undirected
domain: either arc creates one edge, parallel edges count once and loops
are removed. Edge weights, mode, cutoff and path-weight inversion are
ignored. The source also defines a directed variant (its equation 3,
replacing the neighborhood by the out-neighborhood and \\k_i\\ by
\\k_i^{out}\\); that variant is not implemented, so a directed input is
symmetrized rather than being read as the paper's directed case. The
source states no normalization; `normalized = TRUE` max-scales the
finished vector as elsewhere in
[`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).
Cost is two sparse matrix-vector products, O(n + m).

Numerical verification establishes agreement with the two scores the
source prints for its figure 1, not parity with author software, which
does not exist, and not any claim about spreading performance.

``` r

# neighbor degrees are even, H is one and the score is 4 exp(4 / n)
