# LineRank centrality

Computes PageRank probabilities on the graph whose vertices represent
input edges, then aggregates them at the original endpoints. On directed
inputs, edge e can lead to f when the target of e is the source of f. On
undirected inputs, distinct edge states are adjacent when they share an
endpoint, following Kosa et al.'s clarification. This uses one state per
undirected edge. A pair sharing both endpoints is adjacent once.

## Usage

``` r
centrality_linerank(
  x,
  damping = 0.85,
  linerank_aggregation = "probability",
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input accepted by
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).

- damping:

  Edge-walk continuation probability in \[0,1), default 0.85.

- linerank_aggregation:

  Either probability (default) or weight.

- ...:

  Additional arguments to
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).

## Value

Named numeric vector in input node order.

## Details

Line-graph transition weights are products of original edge weights. Row
normalization cancels the starting edge weight, so products need not be
formed. Uniform teleportation uses probability 1-damping; a dangling
edge state also redistributes uniformly. The latter is an explicit
cograph PageRank convention because the source does not pin dangling
behavior. Damping accepts \[0,1), default 0.85; zero is a limit
extension.

Default `linerank_aggregation = "probability"` sums stationary edge
probabilities, following the definition's prose and the later study. Raw
scores then sum to two on a graph with edges. `"weight"` additionally
multiplies each probability by its original edge weight, matching the
weighted incidence aggregation in Kang et al.'s Algorithm 2. These
conventions differ for weighted inputs and are not interchangeable. The
original pseudocode also has inconsistent row/column normalization; this
implementation follows its random-walk definition, corroborated by the
later paper, rather than claiming literal pseudocode equivalence.

Retains direction, loops and remaining parallel edges as distinct
states. A directed loop can transition to itself. Undirected line graphs
exclude self transitions. Both aggregation choices count endpoint
incidences, so an original loop contributes twice at its node. These
loop conventions are explicit extensions. Generic `loops` and `simplify`
apply first. Finite nonnegative weights are supported; zero-weight edges
are absent. `weighted = FALSE` uses unit edge weights. Generic mode,
shortest-path inversion and cutoff do not affect the result. Isolates
score zero, edgeless inputs return zeros, and empty inputs return no
scores.

The native dense line-graph solve costs O(m cubed) time and O(m squared)
memory for m retained edges; this is not the authors' distributed
large-graph implementation. The measure must be requested explicitly.
Unresolvable transition ranges, unstable systems and overflowing raw
weighted aggregation raise errors. Maximum normalization supports raw
weight overflow by scaling weights first; tiny ratios can underflow.
