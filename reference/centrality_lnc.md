# Local neighbor contribution centrality

The local neighbor contribution (LNC) of Dai, Wang, Sheng, Sun, Khawaja,
Ullah, Dejene and Duan multiplies what a node contributes on its own by
what its neighborhood contributes to it:
\\LNC(i)=d_i^{3}\\(1-1/d_i)^{d_i-1}\\ \bigl(\sum\_{j\in
N(i)}d_j\bigr)/(n-1)\\, with \\0^0=1\\. The first two factors are the
source's *own contribution* \\ownCon(i)=d_i(1-1/d_i)^{d_i-1}\\, the
chance that a node picking one neighbor uniformly at random reaches a
given one and misses the rest, scaled by its degree; the rest is the
*neighbor contribution* \\neiCon(i)=d_i^{2}\sum\_{j\in N(i)}d_j/(n-1)\\,
the source's cluster degree weighted by its neighbors' degree
centralities.

## Value

Named numeric vector in input node order.

## Details

The measure takes no parameters. The source calls this out as a feature,
"Parameter-Free: LNC does not rely on prior knowledge and parameter
adjustments", so none is offered.

**Raw scores are not comparable across graphs of different order.** The
\\1/(n-1)\\ comes from the degree centrality of equation (1), where
\\n\\ is the vertex count of the whole network, not of the node's
component. Adding a disconnected component therefore multiplies every
score by \\(n-1)/(n'-1)\\, leaving the ranking alone and the raw values
not.

**The source's printed equations do not literally give its printed
numbers, and cograph follows the numbers.** Equations (4) and (5) both
sum a term over \\j=1,\dots,k\\, and \\k\\ is described three
incompatible ways: the prose calls it the number of nearest and next
nearest neighbors, Algorithm 1 line 12 sets it to the degree, and
equation (5) taken literally carries one factor of \\d_i\\ too many. The
printed intermediates \\D(v_5)=12\\, \\ownCon(v_5)=1.6875\\ and
\\neiCon(v_5)=19.2\\, together with all eleven Table 1 influences, are
reproduced by exactly one pair of factors, the one above: \\k\\ acts as
\\d_i\\ in (5) and as \\d_i^2\\ in (4). The equally literal split that
moves one \\d_i\\ from the neighbor factor to the own factor gives the
same product, so the measure itself is unambiguous.

**This is not the Centrality Zoo's formula.** Zoo section 2.238 writes
the own contribution as \\d_i\|N^{(\le 2)}(i)\|\sum\_{j\in N^{(\le
2)}(i)}(1/d_j) (1-1/d_j)^{\|N^{(\le 2)}(i)\|-1}\\, replacing the focal
node's own contribution probability \\P(v_i)\\ by each neighbor's
\\P(v_j)\\ and the binomial count \\d_i\\ by the size of the two-hop
neighborhood; its neighbor factor is right in form but uses that same
two-hop size where the printed numbers need \\d_i^2\\. On the source's
own Figure 1 the Zoo reading reproduces none of the eleven printed
values and inverts the paper's headline ranking, scoring \\v_8\\ 32.23
above \\v_5\\ 28.90 where the paper prints 32.4 for \\v_5\\ and 29.7 for
\\v_8\\, and lifting the degree-two nodes \\v_6, v_7\\ above the
degree-three \\v_9\\. cograph implements the paper. No Zoo variant is
offered.

Uses the simple undirected unweighted skeleton, which is the source
domain: either arc creates one edge, parallel edges count once and loops
are removed. Edge weights, mode, cutoff and path-weight inversion are
ignored. Isolates score zero, and so does the single node of a singleton
graph: the source has no value there, since \\P(v_i)=1/0\\ and the
\\n-1\\ denominator vanishes, and zero is a cograph extension chosen
because \\d_i^3\\ and the empty neighbor-degree sum are both zero. Empty
graphs return no scores. The source states no normalization;
`normalized = TRUE` max-scales the finished vector as elsewhere in
[`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).
Nothing overflows: the cubed degree is bounded by \\n^3\\, the
neighbor-degree sum by twice the edge count, and the binomial factor
lies in \\\[1/4, 1\]\\. Cost is one sparse matrix-vector product, O(n +
m).

Numerical verification establishes agreement with the source's printed
Table 1 and printed intermediates, not parity with author software,
which does not exist, and not any claim about spreading performance.
