# Multi-characteristics gravity model

Li and Huang's MCGM combines degree k, core number s and eigenvector
centrality x in node masses. Write K, S and X for these features divided
by their respective global maxima. Equations 17 and 18 define
\\\alpha=\max\\\operatorname{median}(K),
\operatorname{median}(X)\\/\operatorname{median}(S)\\, \\m_i=K_i+\alpha
S_i+X_i\\, and \\MCGM_i=\sum\_{j:0\<d(i,j)\le R}m_i m_j/d(i,j)^2\\. The
default radius two is the paper's recommended practical setting. All
features refer to the original graph, not each node's neighborhood.

## Usage

``` r
centrality_mcgm(x, mcgm_radius = 2, mcgm_alpha = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input accepted by
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).

- mcgm_radius:

  Nonnegative hop-distance cutoff, default two. NULL or infinity
  includes every reachable partner. Fractional cutoffs include exactly
  the integer hop distances not exceeding them.

- mcgm_alpha:

  NULL uses the published median-based coefficient. A finite nonnegative
  scalar explicitly overrides it.

- ...:

  Additional arguments to

## Value

Named numeric vector in input node order.

## Details

The source domain is simple undirected unweighted graphs. Other inputs
use their simple undirected skeleton: either arc creates one edge,
parallel edges count once and loops are removed. Weights, mode, cutoff,
gravity_mass, gravity_radius and path-weight inversion are ignored.
These input projections are cograph conventions.

On connected graphs with edges, X is the unique positive Perron vector,
scaled to maximum one. For disconnected graphs the paper does not
specify an eigenvector selection. This implementation projects the
all-ones vector onto the global dominant eigenspace and then scales to
maximum one. Equivalently, it selects the limit of identity-shifted
power iteration initialized uniformly. Components below the largest
spectral radius have eigenvector feature zero; tied components share the
projection. Component roots within 64 times machine epsilon times n
times max(1, spectral radius) are treated as tied. All feature maxima
and medians remain global. Adding a disconnected component can change
scores.

When edges exist but median coreness is zero, the source's automatic
alpha is undefined and an error requests an explicit `mcgm_alpha`. This
override is an extension of the published adaptive rule; setting it to
one recovers equation 16. It is never silently inferred from a different
subset of nodes. Isolates score zero when the mass rule is defined.
Edgeless graphs and radii below one return zero by an explicit
empty-interaction convention, including a singleton; empty graphs return
no scores. NULL or infinite radius includes all reachable partners.

Raw scores preserve equation 18's scale. Optional maximum normalization
occurs after all gravity contributions and can handle very large
explicit alpha values whose raw scores overflow. Dense spectral
calculations and all-pairs distances require O(n cubed) time and O(n
squared) memory. Unresolved positive eigenvectors or overflowing raw
scores raise errors. The published nine-node numerical example is
reproduced at its printed precision. This establishes numerical
agreement, not a universal guarantee of spreading prediction or parity
with unreleased author software.
