# Node Contraction Centrality (IMC and IIMC)

Tan, Wu and Deng's (2006) node-contraction importance, as restated by
Wang et al. (2011). The agglomeration (cohesion) of a graph is
\\\partial(G) = 1 / (N \bar{L})\\, with \\\bar{L}\\ the mean
shortest-path length over ordered pairs; contracting a node merges it
with all its neighbors into one node, and \$\$IMC(v) = 1 - \partial(G) /
\partial(G_v).\$\$ The improved form (`node_contraction_improved`) adds
the same score of the node's edges computed on the line graph: \\IIMC(v)
= \alpha\\ IMC(v) + \beta \sum\_{e \ni v} IMC\_{L(G)}(e)\\, with
\\\alpha / \beta = 5\\ (`contraction_rho`) and \\\alpha + \beta = 1\\,
the normalization that reproduces the paper's Table 1. Higher = more
important. Both reproduce Table 1 of Wang et al. (2011). The Zoo entry
describes the contracted graph as the graph with the node removed; the
sources define it by contraction, which is what is implemented.

## Usage

``` r
centrality_node_contraction(x, ...)

centrality_node_contraction_improved(x, contraction_rho = 5, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input (matrix, igraph, network, cograph_network, tna object).

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).

- contraction_rho:

  Ratio \\\alpha / \beta\\ for the improved form. Default 5.

## Value

Named numeric vector, one value per node.

## Details

On a disconnected graph the mean path length is taken over the mutually
reachable ordered pairs (a cograph choice; the sources assume connected
graphs). Direction, weights and loops are ignored. Cost is one all-pairs
computation per node, so \\O(n^2 (n + m))\\; the improved form does the
same on the line graph, \\O(m^2 (m + m'))\\.
