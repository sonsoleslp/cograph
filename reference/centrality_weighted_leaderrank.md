# Weighted LeaderRank centrality

Li et al.'s weighted LeaderRank adds a ground node g. Each original
directed edge and each edge from an original node to g has weight one.
The edge from g to node i has weight \\(k_i^{in})^{\alpha}\\, using
original in-degree before ground edges are added. Scores follow the
stationary distribution of the row-normalized augmented matrix.

## Usage

``` r
centrality_weighted_leaderrank(x, wlr_alpha = 1, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input accepted by
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).

- wlr_alpha:

  Finite in-degree exponent, default one, a setting studied in the
  source rather than a universal optimum.

- ...:

  Additional arguments to
  [`centrality`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality.md).
  `normalized = TRUE` divides final scores by their maximum.

## Value

Named numeric vector in input node order.

## Details

Raw scores retain total mass N+1 across the augmented graph, following
the all-nodes-one initialization in the original paper, section 2. The
ground score is omitted from the returned vector without redistribution.
The Zoo instead initializes the ground at zero, yielding raw scores
smaller by N/(N+1); final max-normalized scores agree. The existing
[`centrality_leaderrank`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/centrality_leaderrank.md)
uses a different redistribution/scale convention, so raw equality at
alpha zero is not asserted.

Directed arcs are retained; an undirected edge is treated as two
opposite arcs, an explicit extension. Input weights are ignored:
weighted refers to the algorithm's ground-edge weights. Loops are
removed and parallel arcs count once. Mode, path inversion and cutoff do
not change the result.

Alpha can be any finite number. Negative values require strictly
positive original in-degree at every node. At alpha zero all ground-edge
weights are one, including for zero-in-degree nodes. With positive
alpha, these nodes receive no ground resource and have zero stationary
score; if every in-degree is zero the ground row is undefined and all
scores are NaN. Empty input returns an empty vector. These boundary
conventions are explicit; no pseudocount is added to the published
in-degree weights.

A native linear solve eliminates the ground variable and obtains the
unique stationary distribution even when ordinary iteration is periodic.
This uses O(N^3) time and O(N^2) memory. Ground transition probabilities
are calculated with shifted logarithms, avoiding overflow for large
exponents; extremely small probabilities may underflow to zero.
