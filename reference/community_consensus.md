# Consensus Community Detection

Runs a stochastic community detection algorithm multiple times and finds
consensus communities via co-occurrence matrix thresholding. This
approach produces more robust and stable community assignments than
single runs.

## Usage

``` r
community_consensus(
  x,
  method = c("louvain", "leiden", "infomap", "label_propagation", "spinglass"),
  n_runs = 100,
  threshold = 0.5,
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)

com_consensus(
  x,
  method = c("louvain", "leiden", "infomap", "label_propagation", "spinglass"),
  n_runs = 100,
  threshold = 0.5,
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input: matrix, igraph, network, cograph_network, or tna object

- method:

  Community detection algorithm to use. Default "louvain". Must be a
  stochastic method (louvain, leiden, infomap, label_propagation,
  spinglass).

- n_runs:

  Number of times to run the algorithm. Default 100.

- threshold:

  Co-occurrence threshold for consensus. Default 0.5. Nodes that appear
  together in \>= threshold proportion of runs are placed in the same
  community.

- seed:

  Optional seed for reproducibility. If provided, the RNG state is
  initialized once before repeated runs and restored on exit.

- ...:

  Currently ignored. Each run calls the underlying `igraph::cluster_*()`
  function with its own defaults; no extra arguments are forwarded.

## Value

A `cograph_communities` data frame (columns `node` and `community`)
holding the consensus membership. Its `"algorithm"` attribute is
`"consensus_<method>"` and its `"modularity"` attribute is that of the
final walktrap partition of the consensus graph, not of the original
network.

## Details

The algorithm works as follows:

1.  Run the specified algorithm `n_runs` times using the current RNG
    stream

2.  Build a co-occurrence matrix counting how often each pair of nodes
    appears in the same community

3.  Normalize to proportions (0-1)

4.  Threshold to create a consensus graph (edge if co-occurrence \>=
    threshold)

5.  Run walktrap on the consensus graph to get final communities

## Examples

``` r
if (requireNamespace("igraph", quietly = TRUE)) {
  g <- igraph::make_graph("Zachary")

  # Consensus from 50 Louvain runs
  cc <- community_consensus(g, method = "louvain", n_runs = 50)
  print(cc)

  # Stricter threshold for more robust communities
  cc2 <- community_consensus(g, threshold = 0.7, n_runs = 100)
