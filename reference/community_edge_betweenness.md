# Edge Betweenness Community Detection

Girvan-Newman algorithm. Iteratively removes edges with highest
betweenness centrality to reveal community structure.

## Usage

``` r
community_edge_betweenness(
  x,
  weights = NULL,
  directed = TRUE,
  edge.betweenness = TRUE,
  merges = TRUE,
  bridges = TRUE,
  modularity = TRUE,
  membership = TRUE,
  ...
)

com_eb(
  x,
  weights = NULL,
  directed = TRUE,
  edge.betweenness = TRUE,
  merges = TRUE,
  bridges = TRUE,
  modularity = TRUE,
  membership = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input

- weights:

  Edge weights. NULL uses network weights, NA for unweighted.

- directed:

  Logical; treat graph as directed? Default TRUE.

- edge.betweenness:

  Logical; return edge betweenness values? Default TRUE.

- merges:

  Logical; return merge matrix? Default TRUE.

- bridges:

  Logical; return bridge edges? Default TRUE.

- modularity:

  Logical; return modularity scores? Default TRUE.

- membership:

  Logical; return membership vector? Default TRUE.

- ...:
