# Normalize Edge Weights

Rescales the weight matrix. Row normalization is what turns a transition
count matrix into the transition probabilities that TNA models use.

## Usage

``` r
normalize_weights(
  x,
  method = c("row", "column", "max", "sum", "minmax"),
  keep_format = FALSE,
  directed = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input.

- method:

  How to rescale:

  `"row"`

  :   (default) each row sums to 1

  `"column"`

  :   each column sums to 1

  `"max"`

  :   divide by the largest absolute weight

  `"sum"`

  :   divide by the total of all weights

  `"minmax"`

  :   rescale the non-zero weights to \[0, 1\]

- keep_format:

  Logical. Return the input format when TRUE.

- directed:

  Logical or NULL. If NULL (default), auto-detect.

## Value

A `cograph_network` with rescaled weights, or the input format when
`keep_format = TRUE`.

## Details

A row (or column, or the whole matrix) whose total is zero is left at
zero rather than producing `NaN`: there is nothing to distribute. Rows
with a zero total are reported in a `cograph_zero_norm` warning so that
the zeros are a stated result rather than a silent one.

`"minmax"` maps the weakest edge to `.Machine$double.eps` rather than to
exactly 0, because 0 is how this representation stores "no edge":
mapping to it would delete the weakest edge instead of rescaling it.

`"max"`, `"sum"` and `"minmax"` rescale each edge independently and
therefore keep any extra edge columns. `"row"` and `"column"` scale an
edge by a total that differs at its two endpoints, so they break
symmetry and return a directed network.

Row and column normalization are meaningful on directed networks. On an
undirected network they still work but break symmetry, so the result is
returned as directed.

## Examples

``` r
counts <- matrix(c(0, 3, 1,
                   2, 0, 4,
                   5, 1, 0), 3, 3, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(counts) <- colnames(counts) <- c("A", "B", "C")

normalize_weights(counts, method = "row")
