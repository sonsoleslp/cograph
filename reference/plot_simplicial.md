# Simplicial Complex Visualization

Visualize higher-order pathways as smooth blobs overlaid on a network
layout. Source nodes are blue, target nodes are red.

## Arguments

- x:

  A network object: `tna`, `netobject`, matrix, `igraph`,
  `cograph_network`, `net_hon`, `net_hypa`, or `simplicial_complex` (an
  unordered complex — see `ordered`). When `x` is a `tna` or `netobject`
  with sequence data and `pathways` is `NULL`, higher-order pathways are
  built automatically using the `method` parameter.

- pathways:

  Character vector of pathway strings, a list of character vectors, a
  `net_hon` / `net_hypa` object, or any data.frame with a `path` column
  (e.g., the output of
  [`Nestimate::mogen_transitions()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/mogen_transitions.html)).
  If a data.frame with a `path` column is passed as `x` and `pathways`
  is `NULL`, it is auto-promoted to `pathways` and the state set is
  derived from the path strings — `plot_simplicial(mgt)` works directly.
  String separators: `"A B -> C"`, `"A -> B -> C"`, `"A, B, C"`,
  `"A - B - C"`, `"A B C"`. Last state is the target. When a data.frame
  is passed and a `count` column is present, rows are sorted by count
  descending before `max_pathways` is applied. When `NULL` and `x` is a
  model with sequence data, pathways are built automatically.

- method:

  Pathway source when auto-building from a `tna`/`netobject`: `"hon"`
  (default, higher-order network), `"hypa"` (anomalous paths via
  hypergeometric null), or `"rules"` (association-rule itemsets via
  [`Nestimate::association_rules`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/association_rules.html);
  rules are rendered as single-colored blobs because itemsets are
  undirected).

- max_pathways:

  Maximum number of pathways to display. HON pathways are ranked by
  count, HYPA by anomaly ratio. `NULL` shows all. Default `10`.

- pathway_index:

  Optional positive integer vector selecting ranked pathways after
  extraction and ranking, before `max_pathways` is applied. For example,
  `2` plots the second-ranked pathway and `2:4` plots pathways ranked
  second through fourth.

- anomaly:

  HYPA anomaly type to display when plotting a `net_hypa` object or
  auto-building HYPA pathways via `method = "hypa"`. One of `"all"`,
  `"over"`, or `"under"`. Default `"all"`. Ignored (with a warning) for
  non-HYPA inputs such as `net_hon`, `net_association_rules`,
  `net_link_prediction`, character pathway vectors, or `method = "hon"`
  / `"rules"`, which have no anomaly concept.

- layout:

  `"circle"` (default) or a coordinate matrix.

- labels:

  Display labels. `NULL` uses state names.

- node_color:

  Source node fill color.

- target_color:

  Target node fill color.

- ring_color:

  Donut ring color.

- node_size:

  Node point size.

- label_size:

  Label text size.

- label_color:

  Label text color (default `"#e8e8e8"`, very light grey). Light grey
  reads on both white and dark fills when the auto-contrast halo is
  enabled (it is by default). Applied to both source and target labels
  unless `target_label_color` overrides for targets.

- target_label_color:

  Target-node label color. `NULL` (default) reuses `label_color`.

- label_halo:

  Logical. Draw a contrasting halo behind each label so it stays
  readable on any fill — node disc, blob, or the white canvas. Default
  `TRUE`. The halo is the only reliable way to keep, e.g., white labels
  legible when `node_color` is also light.

- label_halo_color:

  Halo color. `NULL` (default) auto-picks black or white based on the
  luminance of `label_color`, so a white label gets a dark halo and vice
  versa.

- label_halo_width:

  Halo thickness in plot units. Default `0.035`; raise for chunkier
  outlines, lower for subtler ones, or set to `0` to disable without
  touching `label_halo`.

- label_halo_alpha:

  Halo opacity (0–1). Default `0.6` reads as a soft glow rather than a
  hard outline; raise toward `1` for sharper contrast on very busy
  backgrounds.

- blob_alpha:

  Blob fill transparency.

- blob_colors:

  Blob fill colors (recycled).

- blob_linetype:

  Blob border line styles (recycled).

- blob_linewidth:

  Blob border line width.

- blob_line_alpha:

  Blob border line transparency.

- shadow:

  Draw soft drop shadows?

- title:

  Plot title.

- dismantled:

  If `TRUE`, one panel per pathway arranged in a grid layout.

- ncol:

  Number of columns in the grid when `dismantled = TRUE`. Default `NULL`
  auto-selects based on the number of pathways.

- ordered:

  Is each higher-order structure a PATH or a SET? `TRUE` treats the last
  state of every pathway as its target (HON / HYPA / MOGen). `FALSE`
  treats every member as co-equal: there is no target, so no node is
  painted with `target_color`, no direction cue is drawn, and the panel
  title is a member list rather than an arrow. `NULL` (default) reads it
  off the input — `net_association_rules` and `simplicial_complex` are
  sets, everything else is a path.

- direction:

  Draw the traversal inside each per-pathway panel: a light-to-dark core
  ramp along the path, a ring whose gold peaks on the side facing the
  next state, and an arrowhead just outside each node aimed at its
  successor. `NULL` (default) enables them exactly when
  `dismantled = TRUE`. A simplex is a set of vertices, so the combined
  overlay — where blobs overlap and a state can sit in several pathways
  at once — cannot express direction; `direction = TRUE` with
  `dismantled = FALSE` is an error rather than a silent no-op. Also
  forced off when the caller has collapsed the source/target two-tone
  (undirected input such as `net_association_rules`).

- direction_cues:

  Which cues to draw, any of `"shade"`, `"ring"`, `"arrows"`. Default
  all three.

- node_radius:

  Node core radius in data units, used only on the directed path (rings
  and cores become polygons there so the ring gradient and the arrow
  offset are expressible; `geom_point()` sizes are device millimeters
  and cannot answer either). `NULL` (default) scales it to the panel
  extent so the nodes keep the size they have today.

- legend:

  Draw the in-figure legend strip beneath a dismantled grid. Default
  `TRUE` when `direction` is on.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`Nestimate::build_hon()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_hon.html)
  or
  [`Nestimate::build_hypa()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_hypa.html)
  when auto-building.

## Value

Invisibly, a `ggplot` object for the combined overlay. With
`dismantled = TRUE` the arranged grid is returned instead: a `gtable`
when gridExtra is available, otherwise a plain list of the per-pathway
`ggplot` objects. `NULL` is returned when there is nothing to draw (no
pathways could be extracted). Called for the side effect of drawing.

## Details

Supports direct use with `tna` and `netobject` models: when `x` has
sequence data, HON or HYPA pathways are built automatically (requires
the Nestimate package). Pathways can also be passed as `net_hon` or
`net_hypa` objects, with labels auto-translated when `x` is a
`tna`/`netobject`.

## Examples

``` r
set.seed(1)
mat <- matrix(runif(16), 4, 4,
              dimnames = list(LETTERS[1:4], LETTERS[1:4]))
diag(mat) <- 0
plot_simplicial(mat, c("A B -> C", "B C -> D"))

```
