# Threshold Edges by Weight, Count, Proportion or Density

Keeps the edges that satisfy every criterion supplied. This is the
network equivalent of qgraph's `minimum`/`cut` arguments and of
[`tna::prune()`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/prune.md), except that
it returns a network rather than a plot setting, so the thresholded
network can be analysed, not only drawn.

## Usage

``` r
threshold_edges(
  x,
  minimum = NULL,
  maximum = NULL,
  proportion = NULL,
  density = NULL,
  top = NULL,
  absolute = TRUE,
  keep_isolates = TRUE,
  keep_format = FALSE,
  directed = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Network input: cograph_network, matrix, igraph, network, tna, or an
  edge-list data frame.

- minimum:

  Numeric. Keep edges whose weight is at least this value.

- maximum:

  Numeric. Keep edges whose weight is at most this value.

- proportion:

  Numeric in (0, 1\]. Keep this fraction of the edges, the strongest
  first.

- density:

  Numeric in (0, 1\]. Keep as many of the strongest edges as gives this
  density (edges as a fraction of the possible edges).

- top:

  Integer. Keep this many edges, the strongest first.

- absolute:

  Logical. Compare `abs(weight)` rather than the signed weight. Default
  TRUE, which is what correlation and partial-correlation networks need.
  `minimum`/`maximum` and the ranking used by `proportion`, `density`
  and `top` both follow this flag.

- keep_isolates:

  Logical. Keep nodes that end up with no edges? Default TRUE. Set
  FALSE, or call
  [`remove_isolates()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/remove_isolates.md),
  to drop them.

- keep_format:

  Logical. Return the input format when TRUE.

- directed:

  Logical or NULL. If NULL (default), auto-detect.

## Value

A `cograph_network` with the surviving edges, or the input format when
`keep_format = TRUE`. Every node is kept unless `keep_isolates = FALSE`;
nodes the threshold stranded are reported in a
`cograph_isolates_created` warning. An out-of-range `minimum`,
`maximum`, `proportion`, `density` or `top` raises a
`cograph_bad_selection` error.

## Details

When several criteria are given they are combined with AND: for example
`threshold_edges(x, minimum = 0.2, top = 20)` keeps the twenty strongest
edges among those of weight at least 0.2.

Ties at the cut point are all kept, so `top = 10` can return more than
ten edges when the tenth and eleventh weights are equal. This is
deliberate: breaking ties on edge order would make the result depend on
how the network was built.
